Sadly the parade is in the morning tomorrow during summer school (which I can't miss any more of due to trying to save up for when I switch to my new job), plus they're expecting half a million people??? at least???

I keep struggling *really* hard with signing up for classes at Crunch (I pay for the highest tier membership so I can choose classes at any location) and then canceling because I psych myself out. I was gonna go to a dance class tonight but it was 60 minutes and that seems like a long time? There's a yoga class tomorrow night I'm trying really hard to pep talk myself into going to, because yoga is my favorite even if I'm so out of practice it whooped my ass last time.

I'm actually wondering if in July, when summer school is over and I can work full days at my office gig, maybe I should take that time to go to the classes I want and can't ever go to - because the majority of their best classes are during the morning hours, because clearly none of us have jobs we need to go to or anything lol. If I did that though, I'd have to work more days of the week to offset the lost time... but I would enjoy getting to go to the classes I've missed all summer so far.

I finished We Were Liars last night too. I read the book and I was BIG mad about it last year when I finished, and this series was super corny at times, like not prestige TV by any means...but I'd be lying if I wasn't just blown away emotionally when I finished the last episode. 

What TV shows should I do next while I have this extra summer time to watch shows? I started Paper Mario trying to game more as well (while I have time lol) but that's more of a 'when I'm bored thing' because the beginning is sooooo slow lol.",6.0

mzfm7u3,RandomHypnotica,"**Your five takeaways for the week!**

* A very stale week with not many changes, although **Manchild** climbs up a position to #2. The highest debut this week is Zara Larsson's **Midnight Sun** all the way at #21.

* ARTMS' comeback project *&lt;Club Icarus&gt;* is less of an album bomb (compared to the stability of *Addison*) and more of a firecracker, charting 5/6 of it's tracks lead by **Icarus** at #23.

* After 20 consecutive weeks, Tate McRae's **sports car** departs the Top 50 for the first time. It's not all bad news for Tate though, as this week marks her 24th consecutive charting week, a new record for her! The previous streak ran from September 25th, 2023 - February 26th, 2024.

* **One Of My Bedbugs Ate My Pussy** marks the return of Cupcakke on the charts, as it's her first appearance since [March 7th](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/March_7th), 2022 (172 weeks ago). The other debuting songs this week were Twenty One Pilots - **The Contract** (#25); Mark Ronson - **Suzanne (feat. RAYE)** (#34); ILLIT - **Billyeoon Goyangi (Do The Dance)** (#45)

* With another week in the Top 10, **Diet Pepsi** moves up to a 4-way tie for 7th place on the [Top 10 leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts#wiki_most_weeks_in_the_top_10). This knocks the 3 songs it was previously tied with (Charli XCX - Von dutch, Camila Cabello - Havana (feat. Young Thug) and Taylor Swift - Lavender Haze) entirely off the leaderboard.

mzgnz0d,2RINITY,"&gt; Looking at the cover art and title, you'd think maybe one idea about America-good or bad-might factor into American Heart in some way, especially because Boone referenced Springsteen as a touchpoint for this album. But these songs are American insofar as they do not evoke a specific time or place and have nothing really to say, so they are just hegemonically American by default. It's not even cloying in the way that Beyonce waving a flag on her album feels a little cloying, or Post Malone carpetbagging into country music feels a little cloying. When Boone sings on the title track‚Äîa song about a near-death experience in a car crash when he was a teenager-repeatedly about his ""American heart,"" there's none of the ironic distance of ""Born in the U.S.A."" or even the national pride of ""Sweet Home Alabama."" Boone is just a 22-year-old from Monroe, Washington, and, thus, American, who has a heart.

mzgkx7s,IcePopBandit,"I have to be honest, this record really, really disappointed me. I think Benson Boone has a lot of potential and he could definitely be a force to be reckoned with, but man, this was such a bland album. I really enjoyed Sorry I‚Äôm Here For Someone Else so I was looking forward to the rest of the album, only to find out it was basically the only decent song on the entire record. I like Mr. Electric Blue but it‚Äôs definitely lacking lyrically, and everything else was just incredibly forgettable and half-baked. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd score the album this low, but it definitely is in the 4.5-6.0 range. His debut album was miles better, and even that was just okay. The lyrics are the biggest problem. The production on some of his songs is really great and has the foundation for a hit, but lyrically sometimes it‚Äôs just so bad that it kills the entire song, which is unfortunate since he has a great voice and seemingly great concepts for what he wants to create.",58.0
mzgn5lq,Three_Froggy_Problem,"I do worry that Boone is just going to become the latest whipping boy whose material gets constantly shit on because everyone has already decided they dislike him.

That said, I don‚Äôt like him either. And I‚Äôm not saying that this album deserves better (I haven‚Äôt listened to it so what do I know) but the more hate he gets now the more it‚Äôs basically guaranteed that in ten years we‚Äôll all be talking about how he‚Äôs ‚Äúmisunderstood.‚Äù

I do think a big part of the backlash against him is due to how he‚Äôs clearly riding his good looks and physical performances and the music itself seems secondary. There‚Äôs very much a vibe that this guy figured out how to commodify himself, that the stuff he makes is not really art but just a product.",192.0

mzgj09i,Kuradapya,"I think he and his team need to recognize that we‚Äôre in an era that values lyricism. His music leans heavily into melody, but there isn‚Äôt much depth or substance to engage with. He has a decent voice, and the enthusiasm is there, but the music lacks a strong sense of personality.

The music video for Mr. Electric Blue tries to tap into a quirky, offbeat style similar to someone like Sabrina Carpenter, but the music itself doesn‚Äôt match that tone or deliver on the kind of humor he‚Äôs aiming for. His lyricism feels surface-level, with no distinct point of view or identity to connect with as a listener.

He and his team need to take the criticism seriously and figure out what kind of personality or artistic brand Benson is meant to embody. That clarity should then inform the writing and production of his music. Right now, the album feels less like a cohesive artistic statement and more like a mood board someone puts together before they actually start creating something real.",190.0

‚Äúman in me‚Äù is definitely one of my favourites of his despite not liking the album as a whole and it feels like a mix of him responding to the hate while being a meta love song.

mzksq9t,blushdreams445,"My honest review as a Benson Boone fan 

Positives 
- sorry I‚Äôm here for someone else is my favorite song and the snl version is peak 
- I like the songs. I think most of them are pretty good. Electric Blue, Man in Me, Wanted Man, and Young American Heart are my favorites that I haven‚Äôt heard before. 
- Momma song made me wanna cry which is good 
- all of these songs would be great as singles 
- I liked the ending of Take me home 





 Negatives 

- The Main Negative: there is no through line. There is no theme. I guess the theme is being a young American but I want more. 
- The problem with this is that the songs don‚Äôt go together. (Hence why I said they would sound good singles). 

-idk how I would reorder the songs but I was thinking about it and momma song and electric blue wouldn‚Äôt fit :( 


Also, I think that the Benson Boone hate is overblown.",7.0

Sorry I‚Äôm Here For Someone Else - Indifferent to it. Idk but I cringe at the 2nd verse ‚ÄúBenny don‚Äôt do it, Benny don‚Äôt do it‚Äù

Mr. Electric Blue - I enjoyed this. I also loved the music video.

Man In Me - Fine. Weirdly reminds me of Flowers by Miley and New Light by John Mayer. Definitely inspired by that sound.

Mystical Magical - Catchy, slaps, moonbeam icecream. Good decision to make it a single. Best song in the album.

Reminds Me Of You - Sounds like a Sailor Song Tiktok Song. It‚Äôs okay..eh.

Momma Song - From all the Mom-centered song I‚Äôve heard, don‚Äôt really feel much about this one but props for his vocal performance.

I Wanna Be The One You Call - Still pretty simple lyrics. Okay key change? Damn his voice is high. Really will not be for you if you dislike his screechiness. Felt like it ended too abruptly.

Wanted Man - Remember Youngblood by 5SOS? And Mercy by Shawn Mendes? But more synth. Feels like a mix of these songs. I don‚Äôt hate it though.

Take Me Home - These type of slower songs are not for me.

Young American Heart - I know people might hate because of the title but I think this is a nice sweet song. Good closer. Fitting that he‚Äôs 23.

Overall: Lyrics are stuff we‚Äôve already seen before but it wan‚Äôt as bad as I thought from the reactions and the brutal critique. I‚Äôd give it that the album stayed on theme. It‚Äôs ‚Äúinoffensive‚Äùbut this sub acts like it doesn‚Äôt eat up inoffensive stuff from other acts, and you‚Äôll only really pile up on it when big critics trash it first. I can‚Äôt see a world where this and Halsey‚Äôs latest album is rated worse than 143. It‚Äôs like they lowered their standards to Katy more even though she‚Äôs been in the industry for a while. I‚Äôd genuinely give it a 5/6. If he was as under the radar as Niall Horan and he wasn‚Äôt so piled up upon I‚Äôm pretty sure it would not net this reaction.",8.0

I've never been the biggest fan of Pitchfork, primarily because I never understood how they were taken seriously as an actual outlet.

Add to that how many losers I've met in life who clearly lifted all of their taste from Pitchfork and have no idea how to talk about music outside of trying to be the funniest comedian in the room, and anytime I see any of these go viral I just feel tired. It's one thing to shit on shitty racists like Morgan Wallen (which they won't even do) or Kanye West (who was still receiving relatively neutral reviews as recently as Donda 2), but far as I can tell, all Boone (and most of the artists who get the patented Pitchfork treatment) did was make a cringe album and attempt to have stage presence.",12.0

I think I remember Pharrell basically testifying that that happens a lot in the music industry and writing credits are fudged a lot of times.

Also not to stir up the ""Beyonce doesn't actually write or produce her own music"" conspiracy (I do truly believe she is very hands on in all the production of her music, esp. after she began managing her own career). But for the original song for Dreamgirls, ""Listen,"" she was originally listed as one of the co-writers (I believe along with 5 other co-writers).  But when the song was nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars, the Academy has a rule there can only be max 4 songwriters nominated for a song, and she was dropped off the nomination. The other co-writers seemed to indicate it was a pretty easy call on who to remove.",408.0

mzf7gl9,gorillafightsurvivor,"There‚Äôs a common saying in the music industry: ‚ÄúChange a word, get a third.‚Äù Basically, anyone who contributes to a song‚Äôs lyrics or composition can claim co-writing credit, even if that contribution is mostly inconsequential. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why songs have 8+ co-writers: most of them were probably in the room, wrote a single lyric or adjusted a melody line, and claimed credit.

Justin Bieber is a good example. His song ‚ÄúAnyone‚Äù was originally written for Camilla Cabello. Her version leaked online a while back, and other than some production differences, it‚Äôs the exact same song. There is a *very minor* melodic difference during the second verse, which I suspect might have been enough for him to go on to claim writer‚Äôs credit for it.

Beyonc√© is another one. Ne-Yo‚Äôs original demo of ‚ÄúIrreplaceable‚Äù had a few very insignificant lyrical differences (e.g., sung from a male perspective, the opening line being about his stuff being in the ‚Äúbox to the left‚Äù as opposed to the significant other‚Äôs), and the changes very well could‚Äôve given her reason to ask for her name to be listed.

https://www.businessinsider.com/ariana-grande-tattooed-heart-meaning-3oh3-interview-2023-8

it‚Äôs actually been posted before to her own subreddit, so even her fans know she didn‚Äôt write in in her room like she claimed. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/ariheads/comments/1hj246o/what_yall_know_abt_tattooed_heart/


i can‚Äôt find a link for the exact interview she says it in, but she says she wrote it in her room and took it to matt squire who produced it for her. not true. 

she‚Äôs also lied about writing r.e.m. there‚Äôs a version out there where Beyonc√© sings it, and it‚Äôs literally the exact same song. Bey passed on it, ari sang it instead. the melody is slightly different, and she opted for entirely different production, but the lyrics are the exact same. it actually started out in 2011 with T. Pain and Pharrell. still, she‚Äôs got a writing credit on that song with Pharrell, and T. Pain isn‚Äôt in the credits at all as far as i know.

eta: when ariana writes her own lyrics, you can tell because they‚Äôre nonsensical. she claims to have self written the tracks on eternal sunshine deluxe, and it‚Äôs clear. she says

It depends on bargaining power and relative status. There‚Äôs songwriting and the actual recording up for grabs.¬†

Licensing songs/recordings for ads/films/tv requires the consent of all stakeholders which can get annoying. Especially with catalog songs where the songwriters are hard to track down.

Ravyn Lenae's ""Love Me Not"" rises 7 spots to around #16 (first week in the top 20)

Benson Boone's ""Sorry I'm Here For Someone Else"" rises 4 spots to a new peak around #27, while ""Mystical Magical"" rises 2 spots to a new peak around #28

Shaboozey surge: ""Good News"" rises 9 spots to a new peak around #30, while ""Amen"" w/ Jelly Roll rises 17 spots to a new peak around #64 (No idea what caused these boosts. From what I can find, the only big thing he did this week was shutting down a major bridge in Dallas to film a music video with BigXthaPlug, which got him some negative news coverage.)

Lil Tecca album impact: ""Dark Thoughts"" rises 25 spots to around #38, while ""OWA OWA"" rises 18 spots to around #51 and ""Half the Plot"" debuts around #77

BTS member j-hope's ""Killin' It Girl"" ft. GloRilla debuts around #42

MOLIY, Silent Addy, Skillibeng &amp; Shenseea's ""Shake It To the Max (FLY)"" rises 8 spots to a new peak around #47

Kehlani's ""Folded"" debuts around #75

Ariana Grande's ""Twilight Zone"" re-enters around #84

Myles Smith's ""Nice To Meet You"" rises 12 spots to around #87

Coldplay's ""Sparks"" debuts around #89 (Wild story here. This is a fan favorite deep cut from Coldplay's debut album from 2000. Recently, there was a video of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin breaking down in tears while performing this song onstage, which people attributed to his recent breakup. The video went viral, and then the song itself went viral. Also, the girl he broke up with? Dakota Johnson!)

Lil Wayne &amp; BigXthaPlug's ""Hip-Hop"" ft. Jay Jones falls 55 spots to around #91 (only song from the album that charted for a 2nd week)

Addison Rae's ""Fame Is a Gun"" falls 23 spots to around #96

It seems like there just wasn't anything special about them. According to their Wikipedia page for their debut album they recorded songs Girls Aloud rejected (who also never broke out in America).",191.0
mz5ow9t,oopsmady,"I am a from the US &amp; a huge Sats fan even still!! It was just that time when 1D and The Wanted were already huge in the mainstream and lots of UK bands were trying to cross over. Girl groups have had a hard time with US public since the early 2000s though.

If you watch the show, I remember Una &amp; Rochelle were the ones who were very weary of going to try to break America. They had been active as a group for almost 5 years at that point. Una just had her (then) baby Aofie, and Rochelle was already married to Marvin &amp; pregnant with her own. The show &amp; the US EP were the only chance to break into America. Unfortunately, it just did not work! They went back to the UK and did lots of promo for ‚ÄúWhat About Us‚Äù which became their only #1 song. 

Unfortunately just a year, they released their ‚ÄúGreatest Hits - Finest Selection‚Äù and had their last tour. They went on hiatus and haven‚Äôt looked back. 

Each of the girls are doing great; Vanessa‚Äôs music is great but she goes on vacation a lot it seems, Mollie is a mom of 2 now and likes to radio host, Una is a mom of 2 and doing her own Irish country music, Rochelle is a mom of 3 and is a TV personality now, and Frankie also is a mom of 2 and sometimes does TV shows.

mz5s2yf,rockerfemmefantasy,"I was a big fan of them and have a huge collection of their work, I loved them but they weren‚Äôt even that popular in the UK I‚Äôll be honest. They started off well but I remember every time they had a single or new album out all the fans were stressing about the chart positions and sales. They usually did JUST enough not to get dropped but I think we were all surprised they lasted as long as they did. As people they were all sweet and nice but they were often criticised for not having much personality and not being very unique. They weren‚Äôt anywhere near as interesting as Girls Aloud or Sugababes and I even remember Little Mix said a couple things about them that weren‚Äôt too nice.

I remember when Wordshaker the second album came out and after the two singles, it was sort of repackaged as the Headlines EP. Wordshaker hadn‚Äôt sold well and they almost pretended it didn‚Äôt exist, it wasn‚Äôt on streaming for years! Headlines was a new EP with some Wordshaker songs and some new ones. An extended version was released later with more Wordshaker tracks. 

When On Your Radar, the third album was released and didn‚Äôt get into the top 20 we were shocked and thought it was the end but they managed another album luckily. Back then pop bands had to do well in general or else. Even Girls Aloud felt the pressure, as they showed on their On The Record documentary.",27.0

It's a slog to start at the bottom again once you've already achieved a decent amount of success in another country and sometimes it's just not worth the push.

mz6miys,ADoseofBuckley,"There are a TON of British/UK bands who either never made it in the US, or certainly weren't as famous as they were over there. If you watch Richard Osman's House of Games they'll make a ton of references to bands like Wet Wet Wet or Take That, who had effectively zero impact in North America. The Brits will talk about the Battle of Britpop there, but here it was a battle in the same way Mike Tyson fighting a 4 year old would be a ""battle"", Oasis was fairly big, while Blur and Pulp are effectively one-hit wonders (Song 2 and Common People respectively are all most Americans would recognize from either band).  

I think it comes down to, for the most part, Americans like American music.

mzft3c6,ira_1991,"I‚Äôve always been into British TV and pop culture, so it honestly makes me a bit sad that some UK bands never got the global success they truly deserved. One Direction and The Wanted were lucky they came in at just the right moment, targeted the right audience, and got that ticket: U.S. radio airplay. But so many other talented groups didn‚Äôt get the same break.

Busted really spoke to British teens w/their cheeky, rebellious pop-punk felt like a soundtrack to the young millenials. They have fun, catchy &amp; humor in their sound but it didn‚Äôt translate across the Atlantic. The US arent into cheeky personalities &amp; music.

McFly is another group that didnt translate because they were too british despite being massively over the UK. They had the same feel as Busted but more rhythm, alot of surf, power pop, britpop and pop rock influences that had this charming, boy-next-door vibe. This kinda style didn‚Äôt fit the trends dominating the U.S. charts.

The Saturdays were all about glam, confidence, and dancefloor anthems which primarly would've been a hit especially at the EDM era in the US. Their image is like the cool big sisters of UK pop. They brought catchy hooks and bold colorful visuals, perfect for a night out. They even had a U.S. reality show, but in the end, they just didn‚Äôt break through in the oversaturated American pop scene and there's not alot of charisma or a member who stands out (i.e. the Harry Styles of the group).

Girls Aloud were in a league of their own . They were more of the older sisters of The Saturdays. They're  sexy, bold, stylish, and adventurous. But like McFly, their sound was so distinctly British, and they didnt bother to promote outside the UK and remained a homegrown act.

JLS had that classic rnb boyband appeal with smooth vocals, matching outfits. Alot of their hits were huge in the UK, especially for younger fans. But in a U.S. market already filled with solo R&amp;B acts and no real space for another boyband.

Little Mix definitely had international appeal their vocals, harmonies, and empowering lyrics made them stand out from the start. Alot of their songs were radio friendly &amp; were pure pop perfection. But despite their global fanbase, a lack of consistent U.S. label support meant they never quite got the spotlight they deserved in America.

Its really all about the marketing and the label push.",1.0

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates! 

#[**Songs**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard/songs)

Congrats to Beyonc√© for sticking with her tried and true tactics winning yet another rate with **YA YA**! It will go great with the other trophies on her shelf! Really at least the top 4 or 5 deserved 9+, but for today we're just stuck with our winner.

* 362nd: Brandy - I Thought (9.106)
* **363rd: Beyonc√© - YA YA** / Lady Gaga - Poker Face / Rina Sawayama - Dynasty (9.105)
* 366th: Mariah Carey - A No No / Muse - Supermassive Black Hole (9.104)

**Songs**

* **thanK you aIMee**? more like ThANK you aimee as it becomes the sub's 69th worst rated song of all time. On the rankings we called it slightly better than Brian Wilson's Smart Girls and slightly worse than Jason Derulo's Wiggle.
* **thanK you aIMee** also becomes the 27th most 0'd song on the sub with 18 to its name. It ties other classics with this number like Ur So Gay, Rico Suave, Institutionalized, and SHEESH.

#[**Artists**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard/artists)

All three of the artists in the rate are our most rated so we're looking at only slight shifts as these extra songs are nothing more than a drop in a bucket (or a couple drops considering how many tracks these projects had). Rankings out of 461

\-

* 163rd: Missy Elliott (7.709)
* **164th: Beyonc√© (7.705) [PREV 152nd]** / Wonder Girls (7.705)
* 165th: Sly &amp; The Family Stone (7.699)

\-

* 280th: Eurythmics (7.377)
* **281st: Ariana Grande (7.374) [PREV 285th]**
* 282nd: 2NE1 (7.372)

\-

* 345th: Alessia Cara (7.139)
* **346th: Taylor Swift (7.120) [PREV 330th]**
* 347th: Jess Glynne (7.112)

Feature Changes

* Florence + The Machine: 83rd -&gt; 90th
* Miley Cyrus: 344th -&gt; 336th
* Post Malone: 410th -&gt; 405th

**Stats**

* **Beyonc√©** picks up her 7th rate win today, extending her lead over the next highest which is The Weeknd at 5. This is more than double Ariana and Taylor's rate wins combined. This isn't even including the extra win she got with Destiny's Child with Say My Name.
* **Taylor** joins the lead on a similar leaderboard as she picks up her 5th last place finish with thanK you aIMee. It joins her other last places in Bad Blood, ME!, Bad Blood (again), and Vigilante Shit. She ties Madonna and Panic! At the Disco for the most in this category.
* **Taylor** becomes the first artist to break 200 songs rated (and thensome) as TTPD puts her at 222. The number is only bound to go up in a few months once we tackle Reputation again. She has more than 40 tracks above her next competitor, which happens to be **Beyonc√©** at 185. With this rate **Ariana** also moves up from 5th to 3rd with 144 songs now (passing Carly and Rihanna) meaning the three artists in this rate are now also our 3 artists with the most songs rated on the sub!
* **Taylor** also breaks another milestone, this one for being the first artist to hit 500 zeroes! She sits at 549 now, which is almost triple the next highest artist (Charli at 185)
* **Taylor** continues her milestone streak as she becomes the first artist to win songeniality 10 times. Her previous wins in this category of robbed cuts include All Too Well, King of My Heart, Style\*, Better Than Revenge, Death By A Thousand Cuts, Out of the Woods, Karma, Karma (again), and tolerate it. (\*Though Style was an odd case of a free-for-all songeniality vote from winners 1, so not a standard win)

#[**Albums**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard/albums)

Well at least Bey had someone kind of keeping pace with her average this time around. Rankings out of 493


* 282nd: MUNA - MUNA / Phoebe Bridgers - Stranger in the Alps / Niall Horan - Heartbreak Weather (7.527)
* **285th: Beyonc√© - Cowboy Carter (7.523)**
* 286th: Lizzo - Cuz I Love You (7.511)
* **287th: Ariana Grande - Eternal Sunshine** / Harry Styles - Fine Line (7.505)
* 289th: Troye Sivan - Bloom (7.504)

\-

* 475th: Lorde - Solar Power (6.586)
* **476th: Taylor Swift - The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology (6.582)**
* 477th: Black Eyed Peas - Monkey Business (6.577)


**Stats**

* **The Tortured Poets Department** becomes the 18th lowest rated album on the sub! Considering the trashing Midnights got fans are probably just glad it's not lower
* **The Tortured Poets Department** also becomes the 9th most controversial album rated! With this addition to the top 10, Taylor now occupies 4 spots on the most controversial albums list with Midnights (2nd), Reputation (4th), TTPD (9th), and Red (10th). 1989 (19th) is also on the top 25 leaderboard
* **The Tortured Poets Department** just barely avoids picking up more than half of the 0s of the rate as it sits at 49.6%, however this isn't enough to save it from 2nd in the overall leaderboard for the stat. Luckily she had something else blocking her from the top spot (hint: it's also taylor)
* Let's talk about something other than TTPD now. **Cowboy Carter** gets a leaderboard spot too! This time for biggest score gap between songs as 4.343 separates the average of YA YA and OH LOUISIANA. It's just barely enough to get her into 24th and into the top 25 for this stat. Also you know when I said let's stop talking about **The Tortured Poets Department**? Well I lied. The score difference on the album between Guilty As Sin and thanK you aIMee totals to 4.328 which is just barely enough to sneak behind CC into 25th for biggest score gaps.

Also the full 0/11 breakdown

* Taylor - 30.5% of 11s, 49.6% of 0s
* Beyonc√© - 40.5% of 11s, 16.8% of 0s
* Ariana - 22.1% of 11s, 6.1% of 0s

#[**Rates**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard/rates)

Considering the tanking TTPD and its 50 billion songs got this actually isn't too bad. Rankings are out of 222

* 171st: Unorthodox Jukebox vs. Purpose vs. The 20/20 Experience vs. x (7.112)
* **172nd: Eternal Sunshine vs. Cowboy Carter vs. The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology (7.108)**
* 173rd: Eurodance (7.104)

**Stats**

* **Beyonc√©** joins the legion of artists to have swept the top 3 of their rate, most recently Charli with BRAT. This is her 2nd time doing so as RENAISSANCE not only swept the top 3, but also got a top 4 sweep!",13.0

seanderlust: this one took a while to grow on me - I think the reason being that I had overhyped it in my head. RENAISSANCE was one of my favorite albums of its year and Daddy Lessons was (hot take?) my favorite off Lemonade, so I was SAT for this. I think I was expecting more of the blues hall, barn-burning approach that she took on Daddy Lessons. Instead, she paid homage to a classic bygone era of country music that I respect, but admittedly don‚Äôt know too much about outside of like, Dolly and Hank Williams Jr. Still, over time, it grew on me and some of the little musical flourishes grew on me massively. I‚Äôm glad Bey put it out, I appreciate the statement it made, and I‚Äôm so glad she finally got her damn AOTY win (though it should have been for Lemonade. Or RENAISSANCE. Or s/t or 4 or‚Ä¶.)

**ahsweeknd** (10.043): this album came out after I had finished taking a ‚Äúmusic history‚Äù course. Truly, I made so many connections when first listening and it felt like Beyonc√© had efficiently reclaimed the genre. To this day, I stand by the fact that it‚Äôs her best album.

**Roxieloxie** (9.609): [I mean i guess its all right](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1ihqizz/rpopheads_aoty_2024_33_beyonc%C3%A9_cowboy_carter/_)

**wathombe** (9.565): I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any secret how much I loved this album last year. I didn‚Äôt really expect it, but it dropped at the end of March, and I really don‚Äôt think I listened to anything else for a month. I just put it on repeat and listened to it start to finish, over and over again. Add to that all the shit I was going through-Ms. wathombe had a double mastectomy in May (successful, thank god), and my mother‚Äôs health declined all year until she finally passed in August‚Äìand I think I will have a very emotional connection to Act II for a very, very long time.

**FitzMarble** (9.022): AOTY. Not even up for debate.",4.0

**pbk** (10): yeah lol obviously this won even with it catching a 0 early on it stormed its way back to 1st and did not let go for a second. it‚Äôs easy to see why too, it‚Äôs such a fun and dynamic hit of a song and it is just extremely energizing and fun. great winner i‚Äôd say!

**seanderlust** (10): Ladies and gentlemen, theys and thems, your 2024 Ultimate winner! This was winning early on and outside of a brief period where it almost fell out of the top 5, it returned to the top position about halfway through the rate and pretty much stayed there. I‚Äôm really happy with this as the winner too - as an ode to the Chitlin Circuit some of the small touches are brilliant (the way it genuinely sounds like it‚Äôs being performed live, for example).

---

**blankspacejrr** (11): beyonce peaks as a balladeer on american requiem. beyonce peaks as the enterTAINer and true tina turner descendant on this song

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (11): it‚Äôs an 11 even if it cuts off weird outside the context of the album. I love this song

**Content\_** (11): this is the easiest 11 of the rate. I love this song

**CrimsonROSET** (11): you know how good a song has to be for me to stay up 3 extra hours the day before just to make sure I‚Äôm in the 11 list for it

**doctypeppy** (11): i think my soul lit up and exploded into some other form when i first heard this. And also it's crazy to see people theorizing that she is going to retire from touring soon when she has only just entered the phase of her life where she is writing songs specifically to be performed.

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): thank you Brian Wilson for composing Good Vibrations for Beyonc√© to sample and interpolate

**ImADudeDuh** (11): i mean what else could it be?

**krusso1105** (11): I didn't predict surf rock Beyonce but if it sounds like this I'm glad it happened

**slimboyfriend** (11): oh she loves a mashup

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): this song alone justifies the entire album and immediately became a top 5 beyonce song of all time upon first listen. i am an act 3 rock album truther but even if that does not come fruition i will always have this song to give me a glimmer of what could‚Äôve been",8.0

**pbk** (10): yeah this just works so well as a classic beyonce pop hit with some of that country twang sprinkled in for good measure it‚Äôs no wonder at all this is top 2. i don‚Äôt think this was ever really in contention to win and honestly i did not want it to but it‚Äôs definitely still an amazing song

**seanderlust** (10): This was my 11 runner up, and all respect to YA YA but god I wanted this one to win so bad. It was only out of the top 5 for a few ballots and flirted with a winning spot for a while, but ultimately lost out. It‚Äôs a great first alternate though - it has the makings of a love song but it has the effortless coolness of riding shotgun alongside your lover. I also love the guitars and piano - to quote our fifth place track - if this ain‚Äôt country, tell me what is.

**pbk** (10): fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck i wanted this to sneak a win so bad. it was looking like it‚Äôd be possible for a moment but then the top 2 started to pull away and i knew it was over. i was really hoping we‚Äôd get a gaggy win off of how uncontroversially good this song is but it was not meant to be

**seanderlust** (9): I‚Äôll admit, I slept on this a bit when it came out! I was much more interested in dusting off my (imaginary) boots and hitting a line dance. That said, it is very gorgeous and is a definitely great pick for the bronze medal.

---

**Nerfeveryone** (11): One of the very few songs that has ever made me cry. Incredible storytelling that weaves myth with real experience, and some incredible musical choices. That chorus where all the instruments come surging in still gives me chills.

**1998tweety** (10): i cant listen to this song without seeing that video of someone death dropping continuously in the chorus

**agreen3636** (10): I had this as my 11 for so long but then last second had to go with II hands but i love this song so much. It‚Äôs so good. It‚Äôs everything. It‚Äôs one of the best she‚Äôs ever written. Perfection. ‚ÄúThe Legacy if it‚Äôs the last thing I do you‚Äôll remember me we‚Äôve got something to prove‚Äù YES MA‚ÄôAM!!

**ahsweeknd** (10): it‚Äôs a lot of carriages if you think about it

**Ambrosia42** (10): the gorgeous

**apatel27** (10): Bey at her best

**asadprofessorplum** (10): I love when a piece of culture drops during the Super Bowl and even more when it‚Äôs GOOD (this is The Cloverfield Paradox shade)

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): Easily the third best song in this album, I like the inspirational lyrics A LOT

**buildingigloos** (10): When this dropped with Texas Hold Em I was amazed. I see why she didn't make it the lead, but it's the vastly superior song

**ConnerY2323** (10): such a weird one to release before the album because this blossomed for me in context

**CrimsonROSET** (10): that one tweet

**darj** (10): CINEMA

**doctypeppy** (10): The comment i wrote before going to the concert- ""Writing this before she inevitably mixes this with break my soul or something else stupid on the tour""

**dreamingpastel** (10): I feel like my love for this song has only grown since I first listened to it. It has such good build-up to a very grandiose climax.

**FitzMarble** (10): SIXTEEN CARRIAGES! DRIVING AWAY! WHILE I WATCH THEM RIDE WITH MY FEARS AWAY!

**frogaranaman** (10): do I need to watch the first 15 Carriages to understand the 16th

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I was a Texas hold em girlie when both song dropped at first, however I think this aged better and it‚Äôs one of her most gorgeous songs.

**ahsweeknd** (9.706): Her best album to date.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9.471): 9.47 yeah i knew i'd have one of the highest average scores for this album but it's legitimately one of my all-time favourites so idcccccc. i can't believe i was doubting ariana before it was released bc it's still heavy in rotation for me and the deluxe just reinvigorated my love for it.

**MasterWizardRyan** (9.441): one of my favorite projects of last year. she did the damn thing.

**kauai6** (9.412): we all remember where we were when YES, AND dropped

**jaztinax** (9.112): my personal AOTY. i had this on repeat ALLL year and we‚Äôre halfway through 2025 and i still haven‚Äôt grown tired of it. not giving every song a 10 was hard tbh because if i were to rank this just as an album without considering each track, it easily would be a 10/10. i love the bonus tracks as well, but honestly think the album is fine without too.

**wathombe** (8.941): This was just a very relaxing and enjoyable early-year album for me. The kind of thing I would put on for pleasant vibes before COWBOY CARTER dropped. Quite a few standout tracks, and no egregious skips.

**nooodisaster** (8.735): I was going to tank every Taylor/Bey song if the deluxe Bright Days songs weren't included so ty for including them! This was my 2024 AOTY and it's even better as a deluxe. Ariana they can never make me hate you.

**Alumineous** (8.706): I‚Äôve been on a Positions kick recently, and it‚Äôs kinda dimmed this album a bit for me. There‚Äôs a bit of a venomous energy from her here, due to the vitriol by the public versus the more playful energy in Positions. And I do have to say it, it‚Äôs really short. Being released so early in the year, it was eclipsed by the other releases in the year. But I do love how this album was more of a ""here you go"" kinda thing, like she just had things to say, she's in happy relationship, and let's give the fans what they want.

**FitzMarble** (8.500): I‚Äôve really enjoyed listening to this album on train rides - it matches that vibe really well, and I think this is a very good (though perhaps not quite truly great) body of work with a very nice sound.",2.0

**seanderlust** (11): oh WCBF my beloved. As sickening (in the gay way) as an all-Beyonce top three is, I was secretly pulling for this one to pull out a win. Alas, instead it had to crawl its way back up from an early day 3 cut to come out in a very respectable fourth. So let me explain why I love this one so much. I love the double meaning of a breakup and her relationship with the media/her fanbase. I love the production - yes it‚Äôs a Robyn vamp but Body Talk has got to be in my top 20 albums of all time so I really don‚Äôt mind it. The pulsating synths give me life. The bridge is a full ascension into heaven. Also, I‚Äôm gonna keep this high-level because this is not my therapist‚Äôs office but to make a long story short, I went through a break-up midway through last year that *hit*. A few days after, I was feeling low and I was trying to figure out if me and the ex could still be friends. I felt like he could have been my best friend if we didn‚Äôt date, and I was missing just talking to him and joking, I was grieving the loss of future little adventures‚Ä¶I was going through it. Anyways, I watched the mv of this that day and I just started BAWLING. After that, got fully obsessed with this song. I‚Äôm doing a lot better emotionally now (and fwiw we actually did end up making peace and being pretty good friends) but this song still hits me in the feelings in a nostalgic sense. Also, sorry - it‚Äôs a banger. Oh well. Congrats on the podium sweep, Cowboy Carter.

**pbk** (4): we can‚Äôt win rates (wait for all stars). honestly i think the biggest gag of the rate is that there was basically no point where this song was in contention to win. with the most 11s in the rate by a LOT people seemed to think this was a shoo-in to win but i don‚Äôt think it even reached the top 2 ever? maybe the rank graphs will prove me wrong but honestly to me it was always clear this song was not going to win against 3 powerhouse beyonce songs.

**dreamingpastel** (11): I listened to this so much when the album dropped. I must've spent an entire week with this on loop. It's just a perfect song from beginning to end.

**TiltControls** (11): I've heard it called a knock-off Dancing on my Own which is fine by me as anything as good as a sliver of that song is still a 10/10

**seanderlust** (9): this as an opener is the perfect pick because it really does feel like an opening number from a wildly successful Broadway musical. It‚Äôs also amazing to just sit and listen to the instrumentation - there‚Äôs so much going on, especially as the pace picks up. While I‚Äôm a little surprised this made it as far as it did, it is a welcome presence in the top 5.

**pbk** (6.5): this is pretty and cinematic and nice but top 5 is crazy. as a song to listen to outside of the album i just find this pretty dull even if i think it works in context

**ahsweeknd** (11): AMEN mentioned omg

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (11): Okay. Okay. Whew. How to even talk about this one. What a gorgeous, GORGEOUS song, and a brilliant opener for this mammoth album. It sets the scene perfectly, alluding lyrically to all the adventures to come; it's specific enough to be talking about Bey's unique journey, yet also feel powerful enough to trascend that and feel like a shared American journey. The harmonies are outstanding and so mesmerizing. The production is just... UGH!!! And the fact that this then comes back around with AMEN at the end... whew it's just SO. GOOD. The easiest 11 to give in the world. AMER11CAN TRUTHERS WAVE YOUR FLAGS BABES!!!

**asadprofessorplum** (11): So there‚Äôs this magnum opus‚Ä¶ the outro to this song is heavenly and the best piece of music she‚Äôs ever made.

**avg-vag** (11): HIGH ART, send it to space!

**ConnerY2323** (11): the arrangement‚Ä¶ the movements‚Ä¶ oh beythoven

**DevilsOfLoudun** (11): THEY USED TO SAY I SPOKE TOO COUNTRY AND THE REJECTION CAME SAID I WASN‚ÄôT COUNTRY ENOUGH, SAID I WOULD‚ÄôT SADDLE UP, BUT. What a song omg. The flashbacks to her 2016 CMA performance are perfectly done and are so badass. The way she‚Äôs simultaneously laughing at them for fearing her presence and asking them to stand with her to build a better future. HER MIND.

**jman457** (11): easily one of Beyonce‚Äôs best songs, and for sure her best openers

**Roxieloxie** (11): I truly think this song is the thesis statement of the album, like if you had to boil the album down to only exist in its essentials, it would be be the message of this song. I dont know how to describe the feeling that takes over me when i hear it other than overwhelming. Its not a bad/good overwhelming, it just is. Theres something very ancestral and central to this song, its a reflection, its a cry for help, its a rallying war call across the diaspora. Its put together in such a hypnotic way thats gotten me to listen to this album in full many more times than i probably would've intended to. Theres an entire visual sequence in my head each time i hear it and I'm almost brought to tears. Theres really just nothing like it, I dont know what else to tell you",4.0

**seanderlust** (8): you know what, i underscored this. I‚Äôm writing this comment two days before day one of the reveal so i can‚Äôt change it now, but god everything really works so well. It‚Äôs downtempo which is maybe why i overlooked it, but the seamless transition from RIIVERDANCE?? The genuine love she‚Äôs expressing in the lyrics??? The vocal HARMONIES?!?! Good lord. Oh well.

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (11): This song honestly feels like a revelation, a moment of clarity where everything makes sense and all your fears just vanish. It makes all the twists and turns and ups and downs on this crazy long album feel incredibly worth it just to get to this moment. It feels like the absolute climax of the entire album, and leaves you with a sense of triumph and victory that hangs over and compliments the remaining songs. In a discography full of numerous highlights, this song stands out as one of Beyonce‚Äôs most laudable achievements.

**Restless\_Dill16** (11): I was instantly enchanted the first time I heard this song. Something about that chorus is so magical, so vivid.

**team\_kockroach** (11): It‚Äôs funny, because 16 Carriages was my favorite COWBOY CARTER song on first listen. This one isn‚Äôt as silly and fun as Ya Ya, and its lyrics aren‚Äôt as bold and declarative as American Requiem or Daughter, but the replay value on this song is incredible. I‚Äôm just so amazed by how warm this feels.

**Overall Average**: 6.582 **// Average Controversy:** 2.357

seanderlust: A/U: on April 19, 2024, taylor puts out THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT - THE SEANTHOLOGY. The track list is as follows: 1) Fortnight (feat. Post Malone), 2) So Long, London, 3) How Did It End?, 4) Florida!!! (feat. Florence and the Machine), 5) Guilty as Sin?, 6) So High School, 7) But Daddy, I Love Him, 8) The Prophecy, 9) I Can Do It With A Broken Heart, 10) Clara Bow. Bonus track, The Manuscript. She writes 31 songs in total, but scraps most of them and gives a couple of the cut tracks to indie bands (Robin goes to The National, The Black Dog goes to hmm‚Ä¶The Last Dinner Party maybe for a weirdo theatrical spin?, etc) for some sweet, sweet indie cred. It's pitched as a story of getting out of a relationship, going through a depression, taking a fun girls trip with Florence Welch (relatable), having a rebound with a deeply toxic but smoking hot man, and diving into work to move forward in life. The run time is 44 minutes. It's loved by fans and non-swifties alike, and gets massive critical acclaim along with Pitchfork‚Äôs BNM. Beyonce still wins AOTY at the grammies, but this goes down as a beloved album in taylor's discography. Also since this is my a/u, Kamala is president and she turns into the socialist demon that the Newsmax crowd was terrified she secretly was, and Elon, Trump and RFK are all dead from brain worms. That doesn't really have anything to do with the album, but while I'm retconning history...

**Stryxen** (9.677): hated this on leak night. is now my 8th most streamed album of all time. What I love most about TTPD is how each song takes a pretty clever metaphor, and finds every single conceivable nook and cranny to explore, it adds to the concept of discrete chapters in ‚Äúthe anthology‚Äù of the department, like each track is a case file, no song here leaves me wanting more but there's always something new to uncover on repeat listens.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.435): someone needs to reintroduce Taylor to drums

**Nagisoid** (9.194): ikr I gave it a full listen for the first time recently and was shocked by how interesting &amp; experimental it is.

**FitzMarble** (9.129): I will forever defend this album until the day when everyone realizes that it actually is worth looking at from a fair perspective (even if they never personally come around to its many positives. I think this a super interesting and really good album, one that is perfect for what it is: a cathartic and messy expression of a tumultuous time/relationships, more broadly even then just Matty/Joe/Travis. At the same time, it also has some of the tightest and most expressive writing of her career - I love all the Swift-words here that you can tell she really wanted to use in a song, but it‚Äôs impressive how well she writes - even if sometimes it‚Äôs not sophisticated, but instead intentionally a bit corny and awkward (again - that‚Äôs the point of the album!!). Endlessly relatable, and the production actually has a lot of hidden detail that makes it re-listenable despite sometimes being overly samey, especially on a surface level.",3.0

**pbk** (10): the singular ballot where this was winning healed me‚Ä¶ this was clinging to the top 5 for a while but unfortunately some last second pro-beyonce/anti-taylor/both ballots knocked it off its pedestal. honestly i think this is the best song left in the rate at this point but i CERTAINLY think it‚Äôs better than a few of the cuts above it. sure, winning may have been pushing it but this easily deserved top 5 in a universe where we rated music and not the artists making it

**seanderlust** (8): One of the things that‚Äôs really interesting about the Taylor fanbase as someone who wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs a full Swiftie but does like an awful lot of her songs to be SwiftlyNeutral is the songs that the fanbase is drawn to that I‚Äôm not. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - the hook is nice and it‚Äôs overall a pretty good song, but I remember when this had a lot of fans during the PH 100 of 2024, I was like [‚Äú...her?](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tenor.com%2FajuaRoG2aQ0AAAAC%2Fher-arrested.gif&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=4bbc1d83cfdd84ba724e874284ef19d600f30a6a9fc6961a893898e348be09fb) Oh well, overall kind of a bop so I‚Äôm not mad at it. With this, we say goodbye to Taylor in 7th place, which given how she started today is perfectly respectable.

---

**1998tweety** (11): I gotta hand it to the Gaylors, they kinda ate with this one. Like I'm sorry, you can't listen to this song and not see the gay allusions. ""I choose you and me...religiously"" I fear I will be playing that at my wedding.

**Brilliant-Primary500** (11): easily the best song from this song, I'm still appalled that out of the songs she could pick as a single, she never promoted this one even though it has the potential to be a cornerstone in her discography. Out of all the ""sexual"" songs she ever did, this is easily the best one she ever written by a long shot. I feel like in a decade, this probably the only song in the standard edition that the general public will even has an ounce of awareness to play and I'm so fucking disappointed that she never made something as good as this in the first half ever again.

**IIIHenryIII** (11): THE masturbation anthem

**PSSST12** (11): This is is her best horny song EVER I fear. Classic status in my household. However, if this was a country song, this could've been my number 1 Tay song.

**ricki** (11): i can only assume that the only thing that feels more shameful than being a gay catholic teen is being a popstar trying to date matty healy

**pbk** (10): something something political joke. this song rules

**seanderlust** (7): ah yes, of course. What would this country album be without having involvement from Dolly Parton and (checks notes) the guy who produced Cry Baby by Megan Thee Stallion.

---

**akane** (11): YAAAAAAAAASSSSSSS the way my soul left my body when I heard this live I was ready to ascend

**DirtyRat583** (11): this is just straight up not country but (on the album) its song 25 and also its great so its allowed

**jackisboredtoday** (11): the bounce in my ass and excitement in my voice whenever I hear that D.A. Got That Dope tag drop

**pig-serpent** (11): Oh.. that's why everyone here is obsessed with Beyonce.  I love how this song is about both sex and love and how they're connected, it's really sweet.  This is a masterpiece huh.

**1998tweety** (10): this song deserved to blow up

**ahsweeknd** (10): this is horny AND sad

**Alumineous** (10): This might have struck a chord with me because it sounds like a really good R&amp;B song.

**Ambrosia42** (10): the sinfully sexy

**apatel27** (10): These strings tho

**blankspacejrr** (10): banger of a banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Dolly Parton getting a feature credit for a one sentence introduction kinda sends me. But also she ate that one sentence why lie.

**buildingigloos** (10): Its so addictive, giddy up giddy up. It's like SPAGHETTIIs daughter

**ConnerY2323** (10): definitely the funniest thing on dolly parton‚Äôs spotify popular list

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Lindsay Sterling get UPPPPP

**DaHumanTorch** (10): take me back to the first time i heard that beat drop

**DevilsOfLoudun** (10): The biggest banger on the album. Some would even say the only banger on the album.

**FitzMarble** (10): frankly the AOTY was deserved from the last seven tracks on this album alone! The beat switch on here (sheer gaggery omg), the way it all flows, the vocalsssss omg!! No one is doing it like her!!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this slaps so hard

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): i am ajayll dancing in her seat to this

**oh\_crow** (10): that bridge is insane she was insane for that. just love the blend of country, pop and hiphop on this

**Roxieloxie** (10): the way I start ascending into the heavens when I hear the washboard acrylics come in, like genuinely if the intro was separated i would 11 that and then the song actually starts and its the greatest song of all time

**Stryxen** (10): WHERE DID THIS BITCH GET A FIDDLE?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): she really saved all the best songs for this last run huh. tell me this isn't about lesbians using a strap on

**wasian-invasion** (10): the natural evolution of the girlboss: the girltyrant / pusstator

**wathombe** (10): After the transcendence of II HANDS II HEAVEN, TYRANT is a slow-burning fuse.

**UltimateTaco** (9.7): D.A. Got That Dope is wild

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (9.5): After the euphoria of the previous track this one kinda falters in comparison, but it still has the feeling of an unbreakable victory parade and I really love that.

**Nerfeveryone** (9.5): Another insane song that shouldn't work but by Beyonce's sheer star power it absolutely does work. The intro is fantastic and then it HARD pivots into a horny ass song that is also fantastic.",3.0

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): 11-ing the nu-disco bop from Max Martin? How original of me!

**Poydoo** (10): ari please why wasn't this a single

**RandomHypnotica** (10): a little repetitive but i‚Äôll bop

**runaway3212** (10): Sometimes saying bye is the best thing to do but also that shit straight up sucks

**Sallynoraa** (10): the single material but her fans lack taste

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): if i see ONE comment about ""bad lyrics"" in the chorus like the focus isn't the production and melody

**welcome2thejam** (10): bye

**ConnerY2323** (9.6): courtney sitting in the driveway like bitch can you stop singing and get in

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): do disco bibles (?)

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9.3): BOPPPP. I love the production, those disco-esque accents go so hard. Was the immediate upbeat standout on first listen for me back in the day.

**blankspacejrr** (9): love how sassy this song is

**buildingigloos** (9): God I wish I didn't know the lore because this song is excellent. The chicken scratch guitar, the key change, the harmonies are all chefs kiss.

**dreamingpastel** (9): Classic Ari vibes.

**Frajer** (9): look this song and boy problems have the same chorus but I'm not complaining

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): so infectious‚Ä¶ i wish she went with this direction for the entire album

**mustwinfullgaming** (9): When I first listened to this album, I was not expecting this to be the vibe of the second song on the album. It's the most immediate bop on here, and boy, do I love it! It almost doesn't really fit with a lot of the rest of the songs. It's definitely my favourite from the album. Love the production, love Ariana's singing here.

**Nerfeveryone** (9): I wish the bridge were a little better but that first verse is stunning, and the chorus is so much fun.

**nooodisaster** (9): The transition to the jazzy snyths, the joyous instrumentation announcing freedom through separation, ""Courtney just pulled up"", the simplicity of the chorus. Gurl it's AOTY, shut this shit down right now.

**pig-serpent** (9): Classic disco vibes but they're softened to suit Ari's voice and update it for the times.

**Soalai** (9): I love this, I think it should have been a single

**pbk** (10): dare i say my favorite cowboy carter song?? it‚Äôs certainly possible. glad it managed to hang on to top 10 for a bit bc i felt like this one had grown off people but i‚Äôve always thought it was amazing and still do.

**seanderlust** (10): it made 10th place because it‚Äôs a 10 :noitstrue:. This one was my favorite off cowboy carter for months. It may be as complicated or thoughtful as the other fan favorites but god it‚Äôs just a great time. Yee - dare I say it? - haw.

---

**ahsweeknd** (10): having a tornado and a heatwave in the city is insane @mothernature

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (10): COME ONNNNNN. LET'S GO (COW)GIRLS! Just an amazing, infectious, undeniable bop. A perfect single too. Makes me want to dance every single time and just feels so joyful. A top pick for me.

**apatel27** (10): And to think this was controversial on release

**asadprofessorplum** (10): Sorry but why are men still making country music after this dropped? I‚Äôve heard enough.

**blankspacejrr** (10): didn't like it at first, but it's really grown on me. the pony up remix is also amazing.

**seanderlust** (7): The winner of the culture vulture feature wars, II MOST WANTED just barely falls shy of the top 10, leaving the top ten with a measly 7 Beyonce tracks smh. The track itself, it sounds nice and I do like the sound of Miley‚Äôs and Bey‚Äôs voices together. That said, do I come back to it very often? No.

**pbk** (3): i just don‚Äôt like this at all i don‚Äôt get much chemistry from them and as a song it‚Äôs just really boring and goes on and on

---

**1998tweety** (10): two queens maximizing their joint slay

**ahsweeknd** (10): such Thelma and Louise vibes

**Alumineous** (10): Best collaboration on this album. Both sang amazingly, no one sang over each other, they compliment each other beautifully.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It‚Äôs amazing that, for how distinct both Beyonc√© and Miley‚Äôs voices are, they blend together so well here. Just gorgeous.

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): Easily the second best song in the album, the sapphic vibes are soooo good, Sabrina &amp; Chappell should cover this song once they're old like Miley and Beyonc√© currently are.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): gaylor and gayriana allegations but we‚Äôre letting gayonce slip under our noses

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (10): Props to Beyonce for understanding that making a song about two gay outlaws in love was a necessity for a country album. Many artists don't know this but it's actually required for every country album to have a song about gay outlaws on it, they've been failing us for decades

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Beyonc√©‚Äôs gayest song?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FUCK YOU RADIO FOR MAKING THIS FLOP WHY WOULDN‚ÄôT YOU JUST LET MILEY GET ANOTHER HIT YOU LIKED FLOWERS SO MUCH AND THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER SO JUST PLAY THIS WHY WOULDN‚ÄôT YOU I HATE YOU SO MUCH STOP PLAYING BENSON BOONE AJKDFVNAKDJFVN

**krusso1105** (10): Still torn between this and YA YA for the 11

**n00bi3pjs** (10): More Beyonce WLW songs please

**nooodisaster** (10): The best song I've ever heard in my entire life. Sold me on the concept of lesbians.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i honestly never expected their voices to work together as well as they do???

**Restless\_Dill16** (10): If we're never getting a sequel to the Telephone music video, I guess this is the next best thing.

**runaway3212** (10): Sorry they also ended here, there's something so beautiful about love

**Sallynoraa** (10): nine for bey and the song and one for miley

**stealthamo** (10): Beyonc√© and Miley are one of those pairings that make a lot of sense the more you think about it. Two women originally from the South who go whichever genre perks up their ears at that particular moment. And their contrasting voices end up complimenting each other as two women who have taken their own unique paths to get to this one perfect moment.

**ahsweeknd** (10): This. This is the moment.

**akane** (10): It‚Äôs just too pretty

**Alumineous** (10): Another song about space in this rate? I think Taylor did it better, but I do love the vibes here. It might be a precursor to Down Bad, if I‚Äôm honest. This love‚Äôs possessing me, then sent me back where I came from?

**ConnerY2323** (10): quietly in my top 10 ari tracks, it‚Äôs just so SMOOTH

**FitzMarble** (10): remix is great, where‚Äôs my supernatural twink boyfriend at???

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (10): The Troye Sivan duet version is the definitive version of this song in my eyes but even without him this song owns

**jasannn** (10): would have been my 11 if this was the troye sivan version. his extra harmonies are missed.

**Restless\_Dill16** (10): I think I slightly prefer the remix with Troye. I just enjoy their collabs.

**agreen3636** (10): BOUNCE ON THAT SHIT!!!! Another 10 baby

**apatel27** (10): The stripped back sound just works so well

**seanderlust** (9): this was tied for my favorite of the deluxe tracks that dropped earlier this year. I like the synths and the mid-tempo feels like the perfect atmosphere for this feeling. Sometimes you‚Äôre over it and you look back on a relationship and go ‚Äúhuh, that was weird. Anyways!‚Äù and move on with your day. I was very happy that this seemed to for the most part hover around mid-to-late day 3 for the entirety of the rate, going out at 14 with our first 8 average of the rate.

**pbk** (8.5): this was a bit of grower for me it‚Äôs nothing super special but it‚Äôs some solid synthpop with a good hook and competent enough lyrics

**dreamingpastel** (10): My favorite song off the deluxe album!

**FitzMarble** (10): this song does such an incredible job of conjuring a mental image and story for me, it‚Äôs honestly pretty incredible

**frogaranaman** (10): crazy how someone you date for such a short period of time changes the entire trajectory of your life

**modulum83** (10): this is just Less Than Zero but Less Than Zero is a perfect song in all its forms

**n00bi3pjs** (10): why wasn't this on the main album.

**nooodisaster** (10): The hits just keep coming

**PSSST12** (10): oh this unexpected serve. . . This and warm should have made the standard edition over bye and yes and omg. . .

**jasannn** (9.5): a much better version of We Can't Be Friends

**jaztinax** (9.5): the vibe is giving high school lovers driving around late at night with the windows down which is ironic because it‚Äôs a bitter breakup song but you know‚Ä¶

**Nagisoid** (9.5): She should sell out more often idgaf

**Poydoo** (9.7): pls not the italianc√©

**akane** (9.5): no one sings like beyonce‚Ä¶ just no one. I consider her the very most skilled vocalist in pop music today and her being able to toss in some opera into a country song exemplifies that

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): Probably one of my favorite performances across the entire rate. Those strings are crisp as hell too.

**EtenKillbeat** (9.2): she literally fit a whole movie in three and a half minutes

**seanderlust** (9.5): that slow down into the chorus scratches my brain perfectly. Usually R&amp;Biana (i just spent a minute or so trying to figure out how to pronounce that out loud) is kind of a hard sell for me but I have to admit this one is great. The beat is perfect, the synths are smooth. I especially love that squeaky one in the very back of the mix.

**pbk** (1): taking one of the most iconic and defining hits of the 90s and desecrating it to justify cheating with a man with a newborn‚Ä¶ and then not even making it sound good‚Ä¶ the synths on this song just sound like sludge to me the song truly fails on every front

---

**DaHumanTorch** (11): such an incredible song, one of her best ever

**jaztinax** (11): the perfect pop‚Äôn‚Äôb bop. the slightly slowed down beat leading up to the chorus still excites me even if it‚Äôs the 200th time hearing it

**Sallynoraa** (11): next time people catch me wrecking homes, i'm blaming arianka

**1998tweety** (10): this deserved to much better

**ahsweeknd** (10): a track worthy of an 11

**Ambrosia42** (10): the smash

**Awkward\_King** (10): getting brandy and monica on the remix was sooo iconic i wish the remix was good or literally anyone remembered that happened

**blankspacejrr** (10): what a banger

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): SpongeBob must be so fucking good in bed that she created something this magical and heavenly.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i want to fuck the Just Dance dancer for this song so bad

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): girl, keep him, you're doing us a favor

**Nerfeveryone** (10): Ariana in her villain era! Max Martin's production on this is absolute fire.

**Poydoo** (10): we love rats

**RandomHypnotica** (10): FUCK morals in songs omg i don‚Äôt care if this is shady af it sounds godly af

**runaway3212** (10): When this song first came out I thought I had literally died and this song was serenading me as I was travelling to the pearly gates of heaven

**Stryxen** (10): mind you she changed this from a straightforward duet to a masterful conceptual meta duet with her public persona/reputation reclaiming her agency and playing up the part of the villain to be her own foil in the narrative discussing her complicated relationship with celebrity. most iconic alter egos of all time: Beyonc√© as Sasha Fierce, Taylor Swift as THE ANTHOLOGY, Ariana Grande as ùìÆùìΩùìÆùìªùì∑ùì™ùìµ ùìºùìæùì∑ùìºùì±ùì≤ùì∑ùìÆ

**seanderlust** (7.5): it‚Äôs fine. Surprised to see it day 3 tbh. Based The Starting Line reference though

**Alumineous** (10): Legitimately surprised someone of her stardom used Find My Friends.

**asadprofessorplum** (10): So there‚Äôs this lowkey-top-ten-in-her-discography-soft-rock-masterpiece we need to talk about‚Ä¶

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): if the standard edition of the album actually opened with this song, it would've been received absolutely well.

**CarlieScion** (10): what a great ¬´and another thing!!!!!¬ª-bridge

**IIIHenryIII** (10): OLD HABITS DIE SCREEEEEEEEEEAMIIIIIIIIIIIIING

**modulum83** (10): I love how ugly and bared this song is. Watching your ex-partner go to your favorite bar, pick up other women, it's so utterly raw and exposed and painful to think about, and the music doesn't slack. Against the numb pain of the verses, the ""drops"" in the chorus sound like knives tearing at your throat. It finally delivers on that explosive, noisy climax we've been waiting the entire album to hear, and it's so, so fucking worth it. This song is honestly painful for me to listen to, and yet when that final outro hits I am screaming too, ""tail between your legs you're leaving!!!!"" and I might be over my relationship now but this always brings it back, lets me relive that pain in the most cathartic possible way.

**nooodisaster** (10): 17th track on this album ""THIS IS HOW YOU START A MOTHERFUCKING ALBUM!""

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): LIKE A MECHANICAL BULL! BUCKING! BUCKING!

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (10): I didn't care for this one for the longest time because of how busy and noisy it was but it all kinda locked in and worked for me when I realized it was kinda the homecoming, dance party ending to the entire album. Like, the hero has returned victorious from their journey, everyone is safe and sound, so now it's time to celebrate and dance and feel good. And characterizing it like that, it really works! The song really feels like one last big hoedown to send us out on and I really like that.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): looking at that horse as I requested by putting on an episode of Bojack after this album

**nonchalantthoughts** (10): ONE THING ABOUT BEYONC√â, SHE‚ÄôS GOING TO BODY A WACKY BEAT!

**seanderlust** (7): not gonna lie, a little surprised to see this one in day 3! It feels like positions-era Ari with the drums and productions with just a touch of this dancier era she‚Äôs entered into.

**pbk** (4.5): this should work for me more since it is a cute simple ditty but it just does nothing for me. i would‚Äôve easily dumped this from the tracklist for warm personally

---

**nooodisaster** (11): The best song ever created by human or non-human beings. From the first second of the fading laughter to her sigh to ""I don't care what people say/We both know I couldn't change you."" Oh I was never the same person. Like I could just copy and paste the lyrics of this song and you'd have to give it a 10 objectively. ""Hope you feel alright when you're in her"". LIKE!?! ""Deep breaths, tight chest, life death."" ""I've never seen someone lie like yo-"" I gotta stop bc I will just write the whole song. I know for a fact anyone who gives this less than a 10 cannot read, hear, or process data. The production one day will win a Noble Peace Prize. The little video game sound effect after ""Yet you played me like Atari""?? Somehow this song sounds so gentle and reverential yet cuts so deep it leaves you breathless. But the beat drops so severe I hit replay like it's a hot piece of ass. Now this will go out mid day 2, but that's not important-

**ahsweeknd** (10): I stand by the fact that this is her second best title track after Dangerous Woman

**Alumineous** (10): One of the best songs in this album, lyrically. I love that I did watch Spotless Mind years ago, so I got the metaphors and references immediately.

**buildingigloos** (10): it's giving nonsense

**DaHumanTorch** (10): runner up for my 11, this song is crack

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (10): Absolutely LOVE how this one sounds, it's so sparkly and delicate

**hikk** (10): when she says atari and it bleepbloops üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è

**pig-serpent** (10): Nintendo Switch daughter vs. Atari daughter.  Love the Cry Me a River flip that has the sense to fade out and have the real hook be original content and the highlight of the song.  This is how interpolations are supposed to be done.  The bouncy riff during the verse makes this my favorite instrumental of the album too.

**runaway3212** (10): It's just so pretty

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a fan favourite for a reason!! we heard the trap beat kick in and knew cunty-ana was still in there

**wathombe** (10): smooth, groovy, and beautiful, all at once

**pheromenos** (9.5): great movie (i haven‚Äôt watched)

**UltimateTaco** (9.2): when you‚Äôre in her is wild

**1998tweety** (9): okayyy her nonsense serve

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): A film that I have somehow never seen. Popheads movie night?

**ConnerY2323** (9): when you‚Äôre in her is diabolical

**dreamingpastel** (9): If I simply ignore the jumpscare that is that one line in the chorus, then it's a fantastic song.

**EtenKillbeat** (9): nonsense's smarter and prettier cousin",6.0

**pbk** (10): i love this song i really do think ari is at her best making simple, sweet love songs like this where there‚Äôs no need for complex lyricism or oversinging or an air of superiority, just cozy vibes and boppin

**seanderlust** (8): it‚Äôs nice, but ngl these next few tracks on the deluxe album i kind of zone out for

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): This deluxe track that she didn‚Äôt even push as a single is one of the best songs of her career. Don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt notice, girl!

**kauai6** (11): this song is absolute perfection, and has been at the top of my on repeat since its release because it's just THAT GOOD.

**Alumineous** (10): You know, as someone who is really independent, this song really hits home for me. We all have that person that just instantly makes us feel better, makes us laugh, makes us smile.

**blankspacejrr** (10): makes me feel like i'm dancing on a cloud

**CrimsonROSET** (10): that one Wendy Williams gif

**doctypeppy** (10): I got oscar gorres mixed up with oscar holter. Either way,

**n00bi3pjs** (10): This song is pop perfection

**PSSST12** (10): a cute bop. I see why it wasn't included in the original because even I don't know where to ruck this one in. .

**runaway3212** (10): Now this is such a beautiful song, I also very relate I fear it's bad for me

**modulum83** (9.7): why couldn't the actual album be like this

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): britney global warming tweet

**ahsweeknd** (9): it‚Äôs good, definitely

**Awkward\_King** (9): pussybdfbdfsdfabffvvg

**CarlieScion** (9): this one was cute!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): sounds like a nice sunny day

**ignitethephoenix** (9): queen of not willing to be single

**nooodisaster** (9): ""I'll be higher than the exosphere"" B/c after the exosphere is outer space and she's finally holding SPACE for herself, Ariana Grande-Butera the lyricst you are!!

**thedirtiestdish** (9): fun

**welcome2thejam** (9): Ahhhh she said the thing!!!!

**ConnerY2323** (8.8): the way these bonus tracks actually kinda work as a mini album and not just a cash grab re-release‚Ä¶

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (8.5): i will like you can really tell which songs max martin is on and i don't know that they're better for it. But the song makes me feel warm and soft hearted :)

**pbk** (5): why is this day 3 my god this boring ass limp noodle of an ending for an album with so much fun packed in it

---

**ahsweeknd** (10): I feel like this is what it would sound like for a soldier to come home from battlegrounds and realize thar their home nation is no better than the enemy

**asadprofessorplum** (10): This closing song being the sister to the amazing opening song is mastermind shit. Reprising the best verse in the album and ending with the Act III outro gives me chills every single time.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): you should have picked mercy

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): oh yeah this is the sort of random loop bullshit I love, we‚Äôre in closing genius territory. American Requiem kinda is the best song of all time

**nt96** (10): the ufo sounds‚Ä¶..somewhere in America, Mulder is breathing heavily, biting his lip with such fervor

**Roxieloxie** (10): Calling back to American Requiem, Amen servers as the epilogue of the album tying together the themes of reviving and reclaiming your history to make something Stronger and better for the future. Its both the end and start of a new cycle as the ending loops back into American requiem inviting you to relisten to the album with a new perspective and more context under your belt.

**runaway3212** (10): Another ender... this circling back to American Requiem, like what a great album

**wathombe** (10): Finally, B gently brings us down. This track makes me almost as emotional as JUST FOR FUN. And after the final note fades? We‚Äôre ready to start again with AMERIICAN REQUIEM. Just masterful.

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9.5): Absolutely love closers that echo the opener, especially when the opener is such a banger. The lyrics are poignant here too, vowing that we'll all overcome the sins of our forefathers. I think that's an especially empowering message in a genre that is so often conflated with holding onto an ugly past. WHAT A PROJECTTTTT

**blankspacejrr** (9): solid reprise

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): As inconsistent as this album can be at times, this is a really great bowtie on the whole thing.

**Brilliant-Primary500** (9): a pretty good ending for the album, the connection it has with the opening song makes it even better.

**buildingigloos** (9): The parallels with American Requiem and how it transitions into I'm That Girl, her mind. Makes it feel a musical almost

**EtenKillbeat** (9): solid ending

**n00bi3pjs** (9): She outdid the Renaissance outro with this song.

**Nerfeveryone** (9): Gorgeous, powerful album closer.

**Poydoo** (9): AMEN

**team\_kockroach** (9): I‚Äôm really happy that Bey decided to end the album on a note of grandiose hope, and I think this reprise of the opener works beautifully.

**thedirtiestdish** (9): so good

**slimboyfriend** (8.9): wait this is kinda making me tear up

**jman457** (8.6): I love how it loops back to american requiem

**1998tweety** (8.5): good closer

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (8.5): I think it could be longer but it‚Äôs beautiful as is

**seanderlust** (8): i love the harmonies here. Also i‚Äôm sorry sometimes it is really hard to tell if you‚Äôre in ‚Äúthe right‚Äù relationship!!!

**pbk** (5): if the extended were rated i wouldve prob given this like an 8 but lets be real the rate is long enough

---

**emayzee** (11): i know im essentially throwing out my 11 on an intro but this song is so ethereal and gorgeous i can't not 11 it

**ahsweeknd** (10): i don‚Äôt understand how so many of her fans heard this song and thought it was a happy track.

**akane** (10): ‚Äúif the moon went dark tonight, and if it all ended tomorrow, would I be the one on your mind?‚Äù is just such a cutting lyric that I can‚Äôt help but love it

**blankspacejrr** (10): she's at her best at this jazzy type of feely song.

**nooodisaster** (10): But actually this song deserves to win the rate

**PSSST12** (10): an 11 Contender OMG. May I say Arianas best actually, if this was a full song? ( We don't talk about the botched extended version)

**runaway3212** (10): Such a beautiful scene-setter for such a beautiful album

**Stryxen** (10): this shorter version is still so good, flawless intro no notes

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): can't believe one of ariana's best tracks is barely 90 seconds long. rare moment a song deserved its tiktok virality

**CrimsonROSET** (9): god she sounds so ethereal

**ImADudeDuh** (9): why does she do intros so well

**jasannn** (9): i still can't tell if this is a love song or a break-up song

**Sallynoraa** (9): just a short sweet song but the lyrics touched me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): rating the extended version bc its much more of an actual song and is also just genuinely stunning to listen to

**1998tweety** (8.5): she always eats her intros

**stealthamo** (8.5): Yes I am a hopeless romantic, how did you know?

**the tortured flava department** (8.5): it's serving DVD Menu in the sense that one of the best songs on the album is just an intro

**Poydoo** (8.4): really cute

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The extended version is fine, but I honestly think a minute and a half is a totally sufficient length for this pretty little intro.

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8): a pretty good opener for the song, the extended version made it even better the more I listened to it

**caaathyx** (8): I don't usually care much about intros and such, but this one is really good and really sets the tone for the album

**IIIHenryIII** (8): beautiful

**modulum83** (8): wow this is nice! i hope the album will stay this soulful and self-aware and heartfelt the whole way through!

**nonchalantthoughts** (8): the extended version is so much better

**Roxieloxie** (8): she sounds really pretty here

**thedirtiestdish** (8): the extended version really elevated this for me

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Normally short interludes (or intros in this case) get low scores from me but somehow she managed to inject pure magic into only a minute and a half

**wasian-invasion** (8): never stop doing these understated gorgeous intros (we dont remember shut up)

**wathombe** (8): a playfully succinct intro with a few nice vocal riffs

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7.8): Love love love the strings here. A great album opener. Really sets a mood.

**Ambrosia42** (7.5): just a pretty intro to the sound and themes of album

1. Mayhem¬†
It very daring, it super cool and some of gaga best hits from her roots. Very talented and very versatile¬†
2. Something beautiful
It very Introspective, very high in production and it is very well presented, the marketing sucks but the 55min film save the album for me
3. Choke enough
It like she overdoing it but also not. I really respect the album lyricism. Her best album , however it just missing a good cord progression
4. Ruby by Jennie
It very versatile. Shows Jennie can do pop,rnb,rap . You name it . I enjoy every bit of it. And I love blackpink
5. Hurry up tomorrow¬†
The Weeknd final album. It closes the trilogy perfectly. The album extra bits are a highlight for me. Cry for me and timeless are so good, but the doechii remix sucks. The album have very good visual and lyrics. The movie is my fav.¬†
6. Even in Arcadia¬†
The rock band done it again. They did so much and yet the album still hit the right places. I personally a signed cd too.
7. Skelet√°
Ghost is forever legendary. Love how unique and special this record is. The story they build and the beats and chord progressions are legendary¬†
8. Obsession by driver era
The album is pretty great. I listen to it to work everyday. The songs are timeless. They never get tired¬†
9. I said I love you first
Selena and blenny blanco got real personal with this record. I enjoy the videos and the deluxe is even better.
10. Louder pls by rise gray
The album is actually surprising. I ended up realising the production and lyrics are like AOTY material quality. So good
11. Eusexua by fka twig¬†
Her album just need some changes to the melody if not . It perfect. The album so fancy and full of bops
12. More chaos by ken Carson
The albums is ken Carson best work. The rap and the diss tracks are so cool. Ken Carson never disappoints. Love the beats
13. Late to the world by ider
This indie band is super cool. The album have great vocals and the productionüéâ
14.so close to what by tate mcrae
The album is so excited and i love the banger . Tate vocals are good.she really is a hitmaker
15. Sable,fable by bon iver
¬†This album is a game changer for me. Bon Iver show his personal side and still made earworms for me. I can't stop vibin.
16. Virgin by Lorde
The albums is AOTY quality. The songs are so unique. It giving melodrama. The lyricism. The music videos and the production is next level. She ain't need jack Antonoff¬†
17. I'm music by playboy carti
The album is a total vibe powerhouse. I am Jordan the best , the intro sick. I can see why this album went no.1.
18. Alter ego by lisa
She have really good vocals however the production need work. Born against the best. And love Lisa alter egos, my favourite is kiki.¬†
19. American heart by Benson Boone
It quite simple but also very personal. The quality is okay but to vibe with this album, you need to be his fan, still find it bad they wrote the album in 17 days

3) I would love to see Lorde and Charli come together again but I just feel like their styles are so different. 

4) although I love this song I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd rank it super high in their discographies. Like they both have iconic songs in their own right. This song is good but is it a top 10 Charli/Lorde song? I mean for me‚Ä¶ no.

i‚Äôd love for them to collaborate again, especially with the way lorde‚Äôs music is evolving, and i think *girl, so confusing* opened the door for that. i don‚Äôt think anything could top it though.

Lordes verse is an all time great from her.

When I was ten, someone said that

**Until you're building a weapon**  
She believed my projection  
And now I totally get it  
**Forgot that inside the icon**  
**There's still a young girl from Essex**

Like are you kidding meeeeeeeeeeeeee. Christ was in the writing session idk. It's one of those songs where I remember where I was when I first heard it. Jaw on the ground, adrenaline pumping, mind racing, immediately hitting replay again and again.  
  
Smart, inspiring, thought provoking, emotionally cathartic, cuts to the bone. Legend shit. Truly Lorde and Charli at their best. The rare remix that not only lives up to the hype but even surpasses the original. It's surreal to realize you're witnessing a GOAT moment from your favorite artists in real time.  
  
This is a diamond in both of their catalogues and I think Charli was f\*cking nuts not to submit it for a grammy. No shade to Billie at all - I get Guess was big on streaming and mv numbers + in theory Billie is a grammy's darling, but just keeping it a stack it's nowhere near as good or memorable as Girl, So Confusing. Like even 'work it out on the remix' is common turn of phrase at this point.  
  
Guess remix is fine, GSC is going to remembered as an all timer banner moment for both Lorde and Charli.",13.0
myye3y0,Screaming_Weak,"Honestly, it‚Äôs easily the best remix of the 2020s and maybe the 21st century. 

It immediately grabbed people‚Äôs attention, and it still does one year later. I know that Charli‚Äôs several other remixes from Brat are also excellent, but I feel like this is the only one that created a cultural conversation whether it was for the girls or the gays, and for that alone, it makes it highly unique.

A year ago tomorrow, I was attending one of my best girl friend‚Äôs weddings, and she married a monster. I knew it at the time (like we all kind of did), but she felt her clock ticking and felt like she had no other choice. I honestly had this song playing all weekend because it truly is so confusing to be a girl.

But to answer your questions: 

1. Love it

2. No

3. Yes

4. Don‚Äôt know where it stands in their discographies, but I‚Äôd rank it a top 5 for both

5. It‚Äôll age very well. I think it‚Äôs very interesting that this was released slightly after Kendrick and Drake dropped diss tracks at each other, and the fact that this remix was two women reconnecting despite past differences vs men squabbling and hating each other will not be lost on me.",32.0
myy7v62,arnnageddon,"a legendary collab, the best remix alongside addison rae's",63.0
myybch5,rotten-tomato1,"1: easily one of the best remixes from the album, while I listen to basically every remix regularly (bar the IMSSS remix), this one specifically is one of the ones I stream the most.

2: not really. it was one of my faves when it dropped and it still is.

3: I think they should collab again, but strictly in songwriting. this song is incredible obviously but it works so well because of the real situation surrounding the topic. any future work between the two of them vocally wouldnt have the same impact. their songwriting abilities though ...unmatched.

4: easily one of their best singles individually.

5: the main legacy will probably be the line ""work it out on the remix"" but truly I believe this song will go down as one of the greatest releases of 2024.",15.0

myzg4ps,wathombe,"Thanks for the surprise writeup! What a treat! I hope at least one person reads this who knows nothing about the song! ‚ù§Ô∏è

1. It‚Äôs really a perfect song, but only once you put it in context. Easily a top song of 2024. 

2. I didn‚Äôt immediately catch all the context when it first came out. My opinion grew more and more positive as I learned all the details over the coming months. 

3. I would love to see another song, but the circumstances would have to be right and the bar would have to be very high. It would be awful if they released something subpar just to be collaborating again. 

4. Certainly top 5 for Lorde for me, but that may only be because I don‚Äôt know her discography as well. Charli has more competition (there are probably 3-4 other songs on _Brat_ and the remix album alone that might be better), but it‚Äôs up there. 

5. I think the remix will remain an excellent capsule of the moment in time that was _Brat_ and pop music in the mid-2020s.

Lorde has always been one of those artists that I appreciate her art, but I was never the biggest listener to. 

So I'm going into the original and hear that it's about Lorde and I start researching and going WHO ELSE OF THESE POP GIRLS HAVE BEEF?!

tangent - im glad lorde got her flowers for it (because she's exceptional on it) but i also feel like it almost set her up for failure with virgin - brat blew up more than charli could've hoped, i would say in part due to this remix, so people were primed for more pop/club-adjacent lorde but that's obviously not the direction virgin is taking (for better or worse) and now more casual listeners are kind of turning away from her. maybe the real lorde summer is the friends we made along the way....",4.0

I was listening to Addison and the verse she calls out Madonna, Lana, and Gaga I was like ‚Äúdamn, it‚Äôs really such a shame Madonna was such a bitch to Gaga when she first started and kept talking about how Madonna was one of her biggest inspirations‚Äù. 

And then I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the work it out on the remix I really want to hear‚Äù 

And I just love that the idea of ‚Äúwork it out on the remix‚Äù has so fit into my vocabulary even internally. I think it hits so much on this feeling of regret over crossed wires and confusion and feeling like ‚Äúcan we actually talk for real about what happened‚Äù that is so hard to do with people. 

In terms of the actual remix: incredible. I love the Lorde verse so much. She picked up what Charli was putting down and stepped up to the plate. 

I see people comparing the originals to the remixes and my favorite way to listen to these two is back to back. It‚Äôs like one long song with Lorde joining after Charli has gotten to say her full piece. It really works for me.",1.0

**seanderlust** (10): We wrap day two with a huge robbery IMO! It‚Äôs a very straightforward cover of Blackbird by the Beatles but given the message of that song (and perhaps recontextualized in the realm of country music, a genre with a long history of uh‚Ä¶not great! behavior towards black folks). Setting aside the context, it‚Äôs still a 10. The OG is a 10, and Beyonce‚Äôs voice sounds heavenly.

**pbk** (7): thinking of the first 5 ballots i inputted giving this song 0 controversy bc they literally all gave it a 7. i think this is unremarkable and severely overperformed but it‚Äôs ykno. fine.

---

**apatel27** (11): Beautiful song done with justice

**ahsweeknd** (10): John Lennon you are DUST!

**akane** (10): The way this was always a favorite Beatles song of mine and she just improved on that by being the best singer ever

**avg-vag** (10): the features and harmonies are gorgeous, vocal perfection

**FitzMarble** (10): a ten if only because of the inclusion of the other artists

**frogaranaman** (10): what I love about this album is that a lot of it is ultimately recontextualization, which makes this song that much more powerful

**IIIHenryIII** (10): man, what are these voices? they‚Äôre not allowed to outsing everyone just like that

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a fucking beautiful cover

**impla77** (10): well this is a bit of a classic yes

**n00bi3pjs** (10): The original song is great, this is somehow even better

**Roxieloxie** (10): If American requiem is Beyonc√© kicking the doors down on the country music industry then this song is her turning back to everyone who‚Äôs in her army with her telling them to go and take what is theirs.

**runaway3212** (10): okay I never knew this song was supposed to be about black women in the U.S. but wow they were right and also my god does it sound beautiful

**wathombe** (10): the features are so, so beautiful

**Alumineous** (9): I never listened to the original, and honestly, after hearing this, I am afraid to hear that version.

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9): Gorgeous layered cover of one of my favorite songs. I love that she clearly used the direct sample of Paul's original guitar, but did so much with it in terms of her vocals, harmonizing with others, and setting the mood with ambient details. It's a cover, but it's a cover that adds something to the soundscape of the album.

**asadprofessorplum** (9): Why is Tanner Addell not having a Shaboozey blowup? I want an investigation.

**bigbigbee** (9): One of the most beautiful voices ever singing one of the most beautiful songs ever

**doctypeppy** (9): giselle doesnt know how glad i am to divorce a song from its glee context

**ignitethephoenix** (9): ended Paul McFlopney

**jaztinax** (9): while maybe not a revolutionary cover, it is an effective one and the most fitting one contextually

**team\_kockroach** (9): There was no way she could‚Äôve topped the original Paul McCartney version, because that was one of the best songs of the 1960‚Äôs. But I love this tender rendition, especially with the vocal layering.",3.0

**seanderlust** (8): :soblove:

**pbk** (6): this is the boring ballad people think most of ttpd is btw

---

**ahsweeknd** (10): I wonder what type of projector Beyonc√© would be. An imax one probably.

**blankspacejrr** (10): such a beautiful song, nearly brings me to tears

**Nerfeveryone** (10): A beautiful tribute to being a parent. Some of the best lyrics in any of Beyonce's songs ever.

**wathombe** (10): already loved this one, but it earned a little extra credit after i saw it live

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (9.6): Lovely, tender little ballad, it gets a little lost in the shuffle as the album goes on but I still love it

**ChopperRCRG** (9): kinda envious ngl

**Roxieloxie** (9): If 16 Carriages is a reflection to yourself, almost asking ‚Äòwhy do I go through it all‚Äô then Protector is the answer of ‚Äòfor the children‚Äô.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.7): this song feels like a warm hug

**modulum83** (8.7): one of the best songs on the album honestly, she just naiils the feel of an old ameriican folksong

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8.5): Such a beautiful lullaby, I love it. One of my early favorites.

**runaway3212** (8.5): okay this is beautiful but part of me is a bit bored I won't lie

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): it‚Äôs nice that it‚Äôs about her kids but also kind of canonically gay because of the Ryan Beatty writing credit

**Soalai** (8.4): She really is mother

**caaathyx** (8.3): So sweet &lt;3

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): :)

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8): this is a very cute song, awwww, if I'll ever have a kid (impossible as I'm a fa-), I'd sing this to them

**CrimsonROSET** (8): why am I crying

**doctypeppy** (8): Beautiful lyrics from Mr Brockhampton Sugar From the Hit Album Ginger, but otherwise htis is one of the ones that just reminds me that my mom told me ""i actually liked that cowboy carter album!""

**EtenKillbeat** (8): really needed to hear that at one point

**impla77** (8): awe

**ahsweeknd** (10): another mental breakdown tbh

**blueberries929** (10): see it in my mind let's fulfill the prophecy

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): how the fuck did Down Bad and that stupid I Can Fix Him song gets put inside of the standard edition, but this one didn't? This is easily the best song off the anthology edition.

**FitzMarble** (10): It must be horrible to want to get married, want to maybe have kids, etc, but to be getting older and feeling like that‚Äôs all slipping away and meanwhile you‚Äôre also one the most famous people in the world and everyone hyper-analyzes your relationships. I don‚Äôt know if she actually those things, though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong to assume she wants to be married going off this album, but the feeling expressed in this song is rough regardless, and I think everyone has wanted to change what seems to be their fate at some point.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): such a pathetic song. everytime i hear this it makes me miserable. what a complete wet rag of a song. ten out of ten.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I‚Äôm so lonely

**pbk** (10): thank god this got as high as it did i was terrified for her‚Ä¶ touch me while your bros play grand theft auto lyric of the century btw!!! try getting felt up by straight boys more often you might like it !!

**seanderlust** (9.5): i‚Äôll give you all a second to go type ‚Äúrobbed‚Äù in the Queup chat. 

Okay welcome back. IDK man this one just works so well for me. The ‚Äò90s alt-pop instrumental with the earworm melody on the hook. Are the lyrics immature and a little clunky? Sure, but that‚Äôs kind of the point - there‚Äôs something really refreshing and exhilarating about being in a relationship as an adult that brings you back to the euphoria of a first love. Sometimes it‚Äôs fun, as mature as you get, to feel like a schoolkid kicking their feet laying on the bed on their stomach, dreaming of that person. If she‚Äôs gonna make this big of a banger, I think Taylor earned a little talking about getting fingered with her friends on the couch.

**Nagisoid** (11): So that was Scripture.

**uiscebeathaoir** (11): One of the best pop song of 2024. It knows what it wants to be and executes flawlessly, the guitar is crazy good, the melodies are excellent. I love the structure that just feels like four or five different choruses rattled off one after another and the instrumental section after ‚Äúlook at you‚Äù is absolute magic.

**Awkward\_King** (10): post malone kinda suckable and fuckable

**CrimsonROSET** (10): yes I have a 10 avg for post Malone in this rate what about it

**FitzMarble** (10): post malone should‚Äôve picked up a feature on an eternal sunshine remix to complete the ult trifecta, he does an good job on this song and fortnight to elevate them (especially at the end of each)

**Frajer** (10): I thought she only wore Dereon jeans

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (10): In which Post Malone reveals he has no idea which Beyonce album he is on

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Post, main pop girl

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the visuals for the album being 3 levi‚Äôs commercials with this song is so ijbol

**modulum83** (10): WE GOT BRO COUNTRY BEYONCE LET'S GOOOOO POST MALONE YOU HAVE SAVED THIS TRYHARD ASS ALBUM

**nooodisaster** (10): Leave it to Beyonce to go from the greatest saffic anthem of our time to the ultimate straight fantasy sex jam.

**Roxieloxie** (10): it really helps that she basically does the 'covering a dogs medicine in peanut butter so they eat it' thing here with post malone so by the time i get into the song and Austin jumps in, its too late for me to bail

**runaway3212** (10): Gagggg, she looked at that musky as man and said ""I can make him have a good song"" and she did!

**TiltControls** (10): honestly they work together amazingly when it comes to the vocals

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): A brilliant pop song, why do y‚Äôall hate Post Malone?

**caaathyx** (9.2): Yeah you can tell Nile Rodgers worked on this song. Post Malone actually sounds great too. This might be my fav so far

**1998tweety** (9): I dont like Post but I gotta admit he ate this a bit (but Bey working with him of all people on this album of all albums is a major choice...)

**akane** (9): still crazy she went for Postie of all people for the duet but it‚Äôs okay bc he somehow slayed

**Alumineous** (9): I hate that Levi‚Äôs Jeans ad so much. And y‚Äôall gonna hate me for this, but Post kinda be sounding like Beyonc√© there. Didn‚Äôt know he hopped in at first.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): If you put all three Levi‚Äôs commercials together you get almost 25% of a music video for this song! That‚Äôs something!

**runaway3212** (10): sorry everyone can suck me this slays

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): Idc this was a great lead single. Could I do without the spoken word bridge? Of course. But that intro can make up for a lot

**wathombe** (10): What‚Äôs not to like? An unapologetic response to media scrutiny, a Madonna vibe, and a fantastic beat. I love the spoken word bridge, to.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): a song ive already 11d. but then it kinda aged like milk on me. but i gave it time and now it sounds good again

**caaathyx** (9.5): So. After hearing this I kind of hoped the whole album would be in this ‚ÄúMadonna/Vogue‚Äù style, unfortunately not. This incredibly well-produced, the majority of the album feels bland compared to this one song

**MasterWizardRyan** (9.5): that lipsync should have been a double sashay btw

**stealthamo** (9.5): Every generation should have their own Vogue.

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9): Actually one of the most unfairly maligned lead singles of the decade IMO. It was a bit of a shock, yes, but that was the point! And it bops so hard! insert your favorite dancing gif here

**seanderlust** (6.5): I feel like I should like this more than I do. The guitar in the background feels right up my alley. For whatever reason though, I tend to start zoning out here and clock back in for Levii‚Äôs Jeans. It seems like a lot of you have similar feelings - while this actually spent several ballots being a late day one cut, it clawed its way back to a respectable 30th place!

**wathombe** (9.5): some of the best lyrics on the album, honestly

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9.3): I absolutely love this one. I can't explain why. I think I really am drawn to the slightly dissonant chords? The guitar and clap percussive elements is so good too. Beautiful harmonies yet again.

**apatel27** (9): I thought it was Crocodile Tears; Is this another Atlantic switch-up?

**CrimsonROSET** (9): her singing voice is so‚Ä¶..

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): these harmonies are so good

**Roxieloxie** (9): this one is sweet i just dont have alot to say on it

**welcome2thejam** (9): Does a good job at the ""pissed as hell and about to go on a musical path of revenge"" version of country

**EtenKillbeat** (8.8): no words

**akane** (8.5): the tour GREATLY boosted this for me

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (8.5): The thing with an album this long is that some of the songs end up feeling like more minor pieces either due to how they sound or just where they land in the tracklist. This song comes off as one of those minor pieces to me. It's very good, but a combination of it coming right after a bunch of big, loud, and dramatic songs and sounding comparatively more muted than any of them kinda makes this song get lost in the shuffle.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): now those backing vocals make this interesting

**jman457** (8.3): underrated song here for sure

**buildingigloos** (8): Impeccable vibes

**frogaranaman** (8): me, someone who has read Where to Draw the Line: that is NOT good

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): maybe my favorite lyrics so far. and there's this great sinister undertone because alligator tears are fake and manipulative, and it's like she knows that but she loves the person too much to care

**buildingigloos** (9): the harmonies and the imperfect for yous are so good

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (9): theres something very sweet and compelling about being so earnestly (or performing the emotion well) about meeting someone and crashing and burning. Makes up for the song mostly being the same verse repeated from different perspectives.

**seanderlust** (10): I clowned this song so hard on release night but I have to eat my words - it has grown on me a lot!

I‚Äôll allude again to something I alluded to in my aimee comment - if you want to enjoy this song, forget who it‚Äôs about and relate it to a time when maybe you dated somebody that literally all your friends hated ~~and they ended up being right about everything in the long run but you know, let‚Äôs just ignore that for right now~~

---

**goorry121** (11): you can tell that she entered that studio mad as hell and i love it

**the tortured flava department** (11): okay first off. It is impeccable this comes after So Long, London. Which had Taylor with a dark and decayed resentment onto a song that is so injected with escapist revelry and desperation it may as well be her Born To Run. And secondly this is a combination of everything I've wanted from a Taylor song, it's got a country-ish rollick to it. The songwriting is just so fucking good and she squeezes every ounce of venom out of every line targeting her own fans for calling her out for dating Matty Healy. And you know what, she's right to call them out, anyone with a shred of integrity could see they weren't doing it out cause they were morally concerned, it was about being able to control and pressure ‚Äúyour fave‚Äù into doing what they deem necessary (and yes Taylor paralleling those fans to that type of suburban Christian neighbour who is way too nosy and extremely nasty is just correct). And yes it isn't the ‚Äúright‚Äù choice, but it was an honest choice, to follow your heart and try to turn an extremely messy rebound into something so grand and in your face, with imagery that is both provocative and joyous, it just speaks to the romantic soul that resides in me. It speaks to my soul. Even if the choice ultimately wrecks her in end. In the end the ethos of this song is who's gonna make my mistakes if I don't, and that just makes sense",5.0

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): i do find it also really compelling how all three women clearly write about gossip about them to different degrees off success or interest (taylor just has so much more on ttpd and they're longer so its easier to get more from those songs at least lyrically) but i also i really do like when her or taylor talk about being lonely or not having the love they constantly sing about because thats become their job more or less.

**seanderlust** (10): this song took a while to grow on me and I have to purposefully ignore the ~edgy~ taylor swift face tattoo imagery in the mv to give it a 10, but i do think it is a 10. I think she does a very good Blue Nile vamp here, the build is immaculate, and to his credit Post Malone sounds great on the bridge. Unfortunately, the response was more mixed here and we say goodbye to the first lead single of the rate.

P.S. ""I love you, it's ruining my life"" still goes hard as a line idc idc

**pbk** (9): ykno it‚Äôs nowhere near my favorite song on the album but it continues the streak of taylor lead singles not doing too hot in rates. obv smack dab in the middle isn‚Äôt awful but i think this song deserved a bit better considering it‚Äôs below the other lead single in this rate which is actually horrid",2.0

**pbk** (10): honestly i had this song as like an 8 before the rate but reading so many bad takes on it really boldened my opinion and now i like it a lot more. i really like her vocal cadence on this one and you really feel the hurt and complicated feelings that come with losing a relationship that you had dedicated literally almost 20% of your life to

**seanderlust** (9.5): Now THIS robbery is foul. As much as I love rightful anger Taylor or played-straight heartbreak Taylor, I love when she dives into more complicated emotions like she does here. This take on a breakup - that she tried to support him but she just doesn‚Äôt have it in her and she wants to be mad but she just can‚Äôt bring herself to be genuinely pissed off for anything other than the relationship‚Äôs inevitable failure - is very well-expressed here. Also gotta politely disagree with some of the comments here - I think the use of momentum in this one, while understated, was very well-done.

---

**mustwinfullgaming** (11): I honestly think this is Taylor Swift's best 'Track 5'. When this track name was revealed, I was worried it was going to be an immature response to a years long relationship ended. But it does so in a beautiful and harrowing way. It doesn't actually paint a picture of an awful partner, but one of sad incompatibility. It is not a diss track. The last part of the song proves that. The production does it wonders, starting with a really cool choir like section (which comes back later in the last chorus). The beat really makes it a standout song too. It's like The Archer but better for me in production. The bridge being more intense with the chant like vocals in the background makes it a fantastic part of the song. It's a really mature song about the end of a relationship that wasn't really to be. And it has some of the most interesting production on the album.

**stealthamo** (11): A highlight of Taylor's lyricism as she somehow leads you through all the stages of grief of a lost relationship in 4 minutes.",1.0

---

**ahsweeknd** (10): The production for the bridge went off

**FitzMarble** (10): the bridge!!!

**modulum83** (10): Boygenius-coded Taylor continues to hit a perfect streak. I instantly imagine this song in a coming of age film, playing as the protagonist concludes her journey, set in a small town on a beautiful autumn day. But the lyrics are more complex than they let on - it's such a thoughtful inspection of her own lack of ability to commit to a relationship, every boy she's been with playing out in montage, loving and leaving all of them - the metatextual references to getaway cars and knowing he was trouble when he walks in. It's a realization that feels like an epiphany for her, and when the chorus ends on ""she fell through the ice, then came out alive"" it feels like clarity.

**Nagisoid** (10): The concept of there being escape in escaping

**nooodisaster** (10): Gives Pixar vibes in that it's really good and Pixar movies are really good

**Stryxen** (10): take me back to that September when the air smelled like There's escape in escaping

**thedirtiestdish** (10): she knows me fr

**impla77** (9.9): anyway this may have been my 11 but i just can‚Äôt get over the awkward all her fucking lives line at such a pivotal moment of the chorus. everything else i love!

**blueberries929** (9.6): Getaway Car: The Early Years

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9): Musically, this song fucking bangs. I love it. Also really interesting narrative take on her own experiences, I love when she does the storytelling approach that she's so good at. My one issue is the cuss in ""all her fucking lives"" feels so forced -- this is one situation where the clean version is actually far superior.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): so simple, yet so catchy

**Soalai** (8.2): Lyrics-wise, this is a really interesting psychoanalysis that probably blends real life and fiction. The production isn't the most unique but at least it has some sway and something that resembles drums. Very evermorian

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): A whole song about how Taylor has dated and broken up with a whole bunch of dudes? 2010 called‚Ä¶

**runaway3212** (10): There is so much to love here, but I especially love the monologue on genres and how they can be limiting, it feels very fitting for country, where artists get accused of selling out really quickly and unless they're taylor swift, lose a lot of sales over this, meanwhile black artists are always told they're not country enough

**wathombe** (10): i‚Äôm forever grateful for the introduction to shaboozey

**FitzMarble** (9): where‚Äôs the Beyonce review of infinity war??

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (9): Part of me would have really liked a straight country album with no twists or surprises from Beyonce, but I am really glad now that she went in the ‚Äúfuck you, country is anything I want it to be‚Äù direction starting with this song, it‚Äôs such a delightful thing to witness. The only problem is that I did not need it explained to me that genre is fake and holding us back I could've figured that out on my own

**n00bi3pjs** (9): The song would fit well on Renaissance if the instrumental was as banger as the lyrics are

**Stryxen** (9): The way I thought he said THAT BEYONC√â VERSE WAS SHIT

**thedirtiestdish** (9): slaps

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): the bop

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The intro alone is an 11 but Shaboozey's verse is a 3 sooo

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8.2): So I LOVE the use of Linda here and how her little monologue speaks so perfectly to the thesis of the album, about this idea of bending and breaking the barriers of genre. Then the actual music part bangs -- or BANG BANG, you could say.

**agreen3636** (8): rapyonce got bars y‚Äôall

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Strange, but cool! I would say this is my favorite of the 5 songs that didn‚Äôt make the original vinyl lol.

**frogaranaman** (8): Beyonc√©, the second she hears a beat that's even slightly off-kilter: I got this

**nonchalantthoughts** (8): needs more sauce!

**Roxieloxie** (8): If Cowboy Carter is a stage production then this song is the one where I‚Äôd like to think we see Beyonc√© come back out and directly address the listeners on the album since the first American Requiem almost as a ‚Äòyeah what, I'm Beyonc√©, what the hell are you gonna do about it‚Äô I'm not sure if it's my favorite track to listen to outside the album, however I do like ‚Äòreintroduction‚Äô it serves here almost like an interlude/transition into the next section.

**pbk** (10): this should be significantly higher that bridge is BULLETPROOF the girls that get it get it i guess

**seanderlust** (8): it‚Äôs pretty good, if a little wordy.

---

**blueberries929** (11): I could write an entire essay explaining why this is the best song of all time but the Swiftologist already made a 40 minute video doing just that so uhhhh go watch it?

**1998tweety** (10): I kinda hated this song at first cause I thought the loml name was corny but it grew overtime

**ahsweeknd** (10): putting I can do it with a broken heart after this was evil

**Alumineous** (10): Ugh, I wish this was about Joe, but he doesn't give off cinephile or someone who likes impressionist paintings. I'm shocked she made one of her most raw songs about a momentary relationship with Matty.

**CarlieScion** (10): you lowdown boy, you stand-up guy!!!!!

**darj** (10): this one makes me emotional üò≠

**FitzMarble** (10): ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never leave/ never mind‚Äù floored

**IIIHenryIII** (10): cringe? maybe corny? yes! heartbreaking? definitely

**Nagisoid** (10): I know Grouper was mad as hell Taylor made this song before she did

**nooodisaster** (10): The best song here, no question. It's like each piano key is weighed down by regret, each line laced with resignation.

**PSSST12** (10): One of her best ballads ever. Greatly written and sung. Matty Healy will burn in hell TRUST

**Restless\_Dill16** (10): The bridge and final chorus are a gut punch every time.

**Stryxen** (10): desolating, ‚ÄúDancing phantoms on the terrace, are they second hand embarrassed that I can‚Äôt get out of bed, ‚Äòcuz something counterfeit is dead?‚Äù is a brilliant thesis statement for the whole album, the past and public jeering at her missteps despite the horrible mental state she was in, and this song alone is full of beautiful contradictory lyrics and with a perfect haunting piano line and chord progression. TTPD is only something a very rich and famous woman could make but i still find a lot of relatability in the concepts of being haunted by your obvious regrets and mistakes when you know you deserve some grace, and beautiful soft music with extremely poetic lyrics is always a win for me mama

**seanderlust** (10): gorgeous song, feels like a spiritual successor to the last great american dynasty in terms of tying a history of women to the present. There are so many small moments in here that i love - ‚Äúit‚Äôs hell on earth to be heavenly‚Äù, the ‚Äúyou look like‚Äù hook. This is a great example of why i wish instead of a double album she had just cut like half the songs in here- this is a phenomenal closer. After all of the messy, post-breakup emotions we‚Äôve seen thus far, concluding the final song with ‚Äúthe future‚Äôs bright/dazzling‚Äù feels like closure ~~lowkey, it feels like closure a lot more than the actual full 31 track closer feels like.~~ in any case, lowkey robbed. This deserved late day two, early day 3 imo.

**pbk** (8): this actually grew on me literally right after the rate closed i‚Äôd prob bump this up a point or two now but that‚Äôs fine my average is high enough.

**ahsweeknd** (10): i just love how open she was in this album.

**asadprofessorplum** (10): Can‚Äôt relate, I‚Äôm a professional hater and clocked in.

**blankspacejrr** (10): gorgeous song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is me every time I don‚Äôt want a song to win a rate but also can‚Äôt in good conscious tank it.

**dreamingpastel** (10): Another song that I love but fear is going to get severely underrated.

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (10): For some reason this is really hitting me now that I‚Äôm rating it, if we did this rate earlier it would've probably been like 2 or 3 points lower but yeah no there's some power here

**n00bi3pjs** (10): I wish I hated this song

**nooodisaster** (10): Like I cannot get over how tender this entire album sounds. This is real life. Fucked up, no clear villains, just a rot that grows until you either live with it or leave.

**PSSST12** (10): One of her best written songs. This will be the best song in this album of inntro didn't exist.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): every album of hers has one song i will cry on a train to and this is the one

**runaway3212** (10): Another fucking spill

**Stryxen** (10): basically fuck my life

**Nerfeveryone** (9.5): Beautiful song, LOVE when her voice breaks on the second chorus.

**EtenKillbeat** (9): vulnerable Ariana at her best

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i've cried to this more than once lol

**wathombe** (9): just beautiful

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8.5): kind of sounds like a ballad from a modern broadway show, like a ""the last five years"" situation. I like the rushed way she says ""I wish I hated you"" at the start of the chorus

**modulum83** (8.1): ok max hit that ringtone beat yeah that's right

**apatel27** (8): Take notes Taylor

**team\_kockroach** (8): People generally seem to think this is a weak point on the album, maybe because that riff is mixed a little loudly, but I thought this one was quite beautiful! I hope it makes it to top 25 in this rate.

**frogaranaman** (7): it's weird being on both ends of this equation

**mustwinfullgaming** (7): We're onto the chiller songs on the album. It's definitely not one of my favourites but the production with her voice is good. It's quite stripped back but it sounds gooood. 7/10

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): She sure knows how to be relatable

**seanderlust** (7.5): It‚Äôs not bad, but I had much higher hopes for a F+TM collab. Their voices sound nice though, so at least there‚Äôs that. At least Taylor was able to ride Hurricane Florence all the way to (early) day two!

---

**ahsweeknd** (10): she was afraid to say Philadelphia

**asadprofessorplum** (10): Florence Welch innocent!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): yeah this is kinda the peak of this album and what it shouldve been centered around musically. imo. feels epic and also fragile and ironic but also earnest...... oh what could have been. thank u florence welch

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She wrote a song about a US state that‚Äôs not California! Is that allowed??

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): FLORENCE!! I do wonder how many states Taylor has specifically mentioned. God i love percussion! FLORIDA!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this winning the rate with a 9.032 average over YA YA, I gagged!

**krusso1105** (10): This is just a Florence + The Machine song for half of it which means it is good

**Nagisoid** (10): Quite literally the only good thing Florida has to its name I fear

**Stryxen** (10): she got florence in the studio and begged to try ethels wig on

**the tortured flava department** (10): florida is not the place to go rn but fuck it they sell it as the place a fugitive would want to escape to

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): what the fuck do ‚Äúlittle‚Äù babies smell like?? the pedo alarm keeps ringing

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): ‚Äòbut this song is so empty and messy‚Äô i don‚Äôt care drums go brr

**blueberries929** (9.1): LOVE LEFT ME LIKE THIS AND I DON'T WANT TO EXIST SO TAKE ME TO FLORIDA

**1998tweety** (9): kind of shrunk on me, need the Florence only version

**apatel27** (9): Can't go wrong with this sound

**dreamingpastel** (9): The drum bit after the ""Florida!!!"" is honestly the best, and it's part of the reason why I have a playlist dedicated to fun drums.

**n00bi3pjs** (9): Florence tries too hard and that makes the song amazing. I still don't know what the lyrics mean lol

**Frajer** (8.5): she's collecting ethereal witchy goddesses like Thanos

**goro\_akechi\_apologist** (8.5): The chorus on this song could've been handled a lot better. The huge, dramatic, crashing flourishes do add lots of thrill and complement the lyrics about chaotic, self-destructive escapades, but they also make the song sound muddy and unflatteringly messy. Still, Florence‚Äôs performance is an absolute delight here, and her and Taylor have a fairly decent amount of chemistry here that makes the song a blast to listen to.

**jaztinax** (8.5): very concerned that her friends either smell like weed or little babies - what is the demographic here?

**ahsweeknd** (10): this gives the vibe of ‚Äúoh yeah, we‚Äôre rich, so this relationship stuff isn‚Äôt as bad‚Äù

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (10): This had potential to be my 11 in a world where AMERIICAN REQUIEM didn't exist. I love the sort of funky production with those HORNS, it hooked me immediately on first listen and my affection hasn't waned since. The lyrics of the second verse are so good. One of my favorite Ari songs now, and an excellent closer for the standard album. I also am a sucker for spoken samples and the inclusion of the conversation with her nonna is a perfect button on the project while also effortlessly summing up what she was trying to say with the whole thing. Chef's kiss!!!

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): i love most spoken parts on albums !! And i just like how this works seamlessly to be about her grandmother or family or a partner

**doctypeppy** (10): Yeah

**dreamingpastel** (10): Having Ariana's grandma pop up somewhere in my Spotify Wrapped was a very real fear of mine.

**wathombe** (10): easily my favorite track on the album, this would be my 11 if cowboy carter weren‚Äôt in the rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Queen of Pop Nonna ended your flop faves.

**Frajer** (9): enough champagne to fill the Pacific

**innuendo\_overdose** (9): NONNA I &lt;3 U, COME TO IRELAND!! SIGN MY TITS!!!!!

**nooodisaster** (9): I don't give a fuck!! The beat hits, the drop hits, the lyrics hit, the ending is cute &amp; the thesis of the album &amp; ties back into the intro. It's just a great song and a great closer.

**Sallynoraa** (9): five for the song and four for the nonna's verse that touched my heart

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): so i was in japan a few weeks after this album released with my fiance and this song was perpetually in my head the whole time bc it's so true!!! any activity with my lover is never ordinary!!!

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): Another full-sounding trap beat that I love to bits! Nonna‚Äôs spoken-word bit works well to cap the album off, just like that spoken word part at the end of Beyonce‚Äôs Lemonade.

**pheromenos** (8.3): take nonna off this pls

**stealthamo** (8.2): Waiting until 2088 for Taylor Swift to take Nonna's record for oldest person to chart on the Hot 100.

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (8): wise words from Nonna for real

**darj** (8): this feels like taking a page back to the sweetener/tun era so maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm drawn to it more. Also shout out Nonna

It seems to be an issue with most new acts imo. Not all but a lot of them, their music is actually the weakest aspect of their package.

The sushi was great, I hadn't eaten there in 3 years and the Yelp reviews were...not kind but I experienced the exact opposite (food was fresh, they asked if I wanted a specific type of sushi put on the train when the review said they asked and got attitude). I bought a little screen print from the university I graduated from, my advisor from my masters program at that school lives in town and we would've met up but he and his partner were going to the museum later than I could stay. 

The museum itself was fantastic. I was moved almost to tears just thinking about how great all the exhibits were, and how long it had been since I'd done something like this when I used to make that trip and do those things every other weekend. I'm definitely going to start putting aside money where I can maybe do it more regularly.

But anyways, in NYC the two front runners in the democratic party are Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdami. Cuomo, of course, former governor of NY and had to step down due to sexual harassment allegations. Mamdami, on the other hand, is a young socialist. Mamdami is an underdog who has recently surged in the polls due to his great videos on social media and endorsements from politicians like AOC and Bernie Sanders. Jessica Ramos, a senator who was also running for mayor and who I have always considered progressive, has recently endorsed Andrew Cuomo. This came as a shock to me and many others. Anyways, it seems like Cuomo and other democrats are scared of Mamdami's rise. They're trying to paint him as anti-semitic, photoshopping his beards in ads so he looks ""scarier."" It just has me thinking a lot about the democratic establishment and how out of touch they seem to be with their base. It seems to me that they just want to keep the rich in charge and the status quo in check. So yeah...fuck some of the shit has gone down in the democratic party.

Perd√≥name mi gram√°tica mala üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Mexico tiene muchas organizaciones qu√© ayudar Palestina como  BDS Mexico, Semillas de Resistencia y muchas otras organizaciones especialmente locales en muchas ciudades (como GDL, CDMX, y m√°s). Una acci√≥n directa ahora es # FirmasXPalestinaMX, es una petici√≥n romper las relaciones con el estado de Israel. firmas.Palestina.mx en Instagram informa sobre los lugares y eventos para firmar la Iniciativa Ciudadana para romper relaciones con el estado (por ejemplo ellos tuvieron un evento en Puebla en la semana pasada). 

Reddit com√≠ el enlace real pero el documento mira como [este](https://imgur.com/a/Pu5IKst) y es disponible en la p√°gina de insta de firmas.palestina.mx

No se peticiones o m√°s en otros pa√≠ses hispanohablantes pero, Colombia üá®üá¥ y Chile üá®üá± tiene organizaciones sobre Palestina y generalmente  sobre los derechos √°rabes como (Comunidad de palestina de Colombia, El Instituto de Cultura √Årabe de Colombia y comunidad de palestina de chile) 

No se por qu√© la pagina en Instagram de El Instituto no existe ahora :( pero esto es su [sitio](https://incaco.org). Ellos tiene clases, y comparten libros y pel√≠culas sobre pa√≠ses y gente √°rabe y ahora especialmente palestinas. 

Tambi√©n existe un organizaci√≥n de BDS de Per√∫ üáµüá™ y en muchos pa√≠ses! 

Tambi√©n tengo enlaces a unos libros sobre Palestina en espa√±ol [aqu√≠](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/s/j7tvsOAYJ8) 

Si tienes una cuenta de insta ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk Palestine‚Äù tiene una cuenta en espa√±ol tambi√©n (con el nombre ‚Äúletstalkpalestine.es‚Äù) Creo que tambi√©n cuentas en otras lenguas pero no recuerdo cu√°les ahorita.

Because I Can absolutely give her extra help...when I have time which I never do because this was thrown at us during the busiest time of year without warning + we were given no actual training in how to help these kids (all current and former foster kids) with the issues they're likely to have so I'm just some guy observing and making things up as I go.

Like idk maybe you should Tell Us that you're sending someone who struggles with the alphabet/doesn't know what alphabetizing means considering this is A Library and that's like 80% of what she'll be doing. She's learning quick but like!!! A quick check in with her and/or with us would've made this way easier for her!!!!

Anyway something something ""I've only had this kid for a day and a half but if anything happened to her I'd kill everyone in this room and myself"" this kid is GREAT I love her to death but every adult involved in setting up this Great Opportunity For These Kids is an asshole who did not do their due diligence and seems to want Good Vibes more than they want to Plan and Prep and Set Us Up For Good Outcomes.

I just don't really like the songs. 

There's something that's missing in the composition, I feel like it's supposed to be going harder. There's something lacking. We are holding something back. And maybe poetically, that's on purpose, but for me, it's just not enough.

myvht0f,CinnabiteSprite,"Hm. This launch confuses me. Here we‚Äòve got a gorgeous, gorgeous video while the actual song doesn‚Äòt draw me in much, both sonically and lyrically. It‚Äòs also the only one of Virgin‚Äòs singles released until now where I can understand the often uttered criticism that the production sounds flat - particularly noticeable in the 2nd chorus.

With WWT, I was instantly enamored by the production, could somewhat relate to the lyrics and loved everything about the video. That song led me to get some tickets for the upcoming show as soon as they became available.

I also loved MOTY‚Äòs soundscape and intensity but didn‚Äôt feel much of a connection to the lyrics. And then the video came out and was received quite warmly here‚Ä¶ and sadly it did absolutely nothing for me. 

Of course I‚Äòll wait until the album is out but I fear that Lorde‚Äòs current persona just isn‚Äòt one I can click with that well. That‚Äòs not intended as any sort of criticism as it‚Äôs just a reflection of my POV and others seem to have better success so far.

Stop letting these artists get by on visuals, fake hype, proximity to popular artists, and previous works of higher quality. 

If someone NEW were trying to break into the industry with this music, and a label were pushing them upfront to us, we would not be praising this for half a second. We would wonder what the hell they are trying to sell us.

That feels intentional to me because it gives me the very specific vibe of the lowkey numb-but-at-least-I‚Äôm-free feeling that can await you on the other side of emotional pain. Is it depression? Is it what comes after depression? I‚Äôm not sure, but there is a clarity of vision that comes with it, and a hardness, and an unwillingness to indulge too much, or a lack of interest. I‚Äôm backing up this interpretation with her (beautiful as always) lyrics, her tone, and with the videos. There is not wistfulness. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm getting at.

I agree with the premise of this article that this is a breakup album, Millenial style, with touchstones in the great breakup songs of our boomer progenitors era.

I think Haim made that clear this was intentional by starting off with a George Micheal ""Freedom"" sample, and ending with one taken from U2. 

I think that's not the end of the references either, it felt like all of the songs had me connecting them to other phantom nineties breakup playlist tunes, ""Cry"" to me sounds like it shares a lot of DNA with Annie Lennox's seminal ""Walking on Broken Glass"".

I wouldn't be surprised if this whole album was built on the premise of the mix tape your bestie brings over with the gallon of ice cream to cry your heartbreak out. 

I hope they share their breakup mix tape with us some day üôè",53.0
myvfjxi,theatlantic,"Spencer Kornhaber: ‚ÄúThe often-cited statistic that 50 percent of American marriages end in divorce has long been overstated: The divorce rate started sliding from its historical peak way back in 1980. But the myth of the modern marriage being doomed to fail endures because it was seared into the cultural consciousness‚Äîlike so much else‚Äîby Baby Boomers. After the sexual revolution of the ‚Äô60s and the legalization of no-fault divorce, they availed themselves of the freedom to leave their spouse‚Äîand then parlayed that experience into now-classic movies, books, and rock about going your own way.

‚ÄúBoomers‚Äô children aren‚Äôt getting hitched as easily, and those who do are less likely to split up ‚Ä¶ But Millennials do have their version of divorce rock: the softly grooving Los Angeles band Haim. The group‚Äôs three members have never been married, but their new album, *I Quit*, cleverly remixes the breakup-music canon for a generation that‚Äôs wary of tying the knot.

‚ÄúSince their 2013 debut, the Haim sisters‚ÄîEste (39), Danielle (36), and Alana (33)‚Äîhave gained fame as pop celebrities who are fluent in TikTok and friends with Taylor Swift. Yet, as a rare band in an era of solo stars, they‚Äôre also a throwback. Haim‚Äôs songs blend the rollicking chemistry of Fleetwood Mac, the muscular femininity of Heart, and the mystic cheesiness of Phil Collins (with a smattering of new-jack-swing sparkle). But the sisters swap the earnest grandiosity of their influences for cheeky nonchalance, hinting that nothing they sing about is all that serious. In videos, they strut down streets like Tina Turner, except with all of Turner‚Äôs outsize emoting replaced by smirks. The band‚Äôs great 2013 single, ‚ÄòThe Wire,‚Äô is about ditching a perfectly nice partner, counseling, ‚ÄòI just know, I know, I know, I know that you‚Äôre gonna be okay anyway.

‚ÄúThough the band‚Äôs lyrics have long been preoccupied with breakups, *I Quit* is the moment these Stevie Nicks disciples attempt their *Rumours*: a kaleidoscopic and questing pop epic about unraveling commitments (though made in circumstances of sibling solidarity rather than burning tension between bandmates). The three sisters were each single while recording the album, and have marketed that fact by sharing dating horror stories online. The most consequential breakup here is that of the lead singer, Danielle. In 2022, she exited a relationship of nine years with the producer Ariel Rechtshaid, who‚Äôd worked on all of the band‚Äôs previous albums. The split apparently represented both a personal and an artistic unchaining. Danielle told *ID magazine* that Rechtshaid took a ‚Äòsearching, labored‚Äô approach to recording, whereas *I Quit*‚Äôs lead producer, Rostam Batmanglij, is ‚Äòquick‚Äô and ‚Äòkinetic.‚Äô The album‚Äôs title is meant to convey liberation: ‚ÄòThe exit is also the entrance,‚Äô Este said to *GQ*.‚Äù

Ok, so today's billboard (and most charts organizations') methodology is:

Single sales + radio play + streams + views of UGC with this music

  
Now go look at Tik Tok, Instagram Reels, and Youtube Shorts. 

  
How many short videos do you see with Ordinary as the background? Millions right? Every time someone views one of those, it contributes to Ordinary's chart score. 

  
Today it seems like the way to go is to appeal to content creators to use your song as background music in their short videos. I'm convinced that this is why Beautiful Things lingers on the charts so long - To this day I see freaking fishing youtubers use it as background music when they make a short of them pulling out a big fish....",-2.0

&gt; We wouldn‚Äôt be able to make that now and that‚Äôs how it should be. It‚Äôs time to reflect on all that. We have to look at the cultural baggage we carry and the mark that we‚Äôve left on the world.‚Äù 

He adds that if he were to make the movie today, he'd hire an Indian filmmaker:

&gt; ‚ÄúThat kind of cultural appropriation might be sanctioned at certain times. But at other times it cannot be. I mean, I‚Äôm proud of the film, but you wouldn‚Äôt even contemplate doing something like that today. It wouldn‚Äôt even get financed.
