#Personal Chart of the Week

One of the joys some people have on the chart is seeing their own impact on the chart. Whether its seeing your #1 song at #1, or seeing it bubbling under, people like seeing songs they like being adored by other users. In this section, one lucky chart participant will see their own chart and the impact it had on the full chart this week. NOTE: In the case of charts exceeding 15 songs, I will trim down the lowest tie to fit the chart by using the songs that charted the highest (or are funniest). This week, we have the chart of /u/anybagel!

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

When Bright, who also co-wrote Justin Bieber’s hit “Somebody To Love”, is asked to explain how Bieber got songwriting credit for that song (as it was originally written for Usher), Bright has no answer. “Umm… How did he get a writing credit on it?… That’s an interesting question. I don’t know.”

When asked whether songwriters earn more money than the artist, she told Free Wired: ""It depends on who you are. Rihanna takes publishing, Justin Bieber takes publishing, Kanye West takes publishing. On all the stuff that they don't write, they take publishing.""",1750710059.0,53,2025-06-23 20:20:59+00:00,20,0

1li38zu,from tokyo to the world - we’re f5ve!! ask us anything hi-5 &lt;3,f5ve_official,popheads,231,0.96,0,231,227,True,"f5ve (pronounced fi-vee) are inter-dimensional dream agents from Tokyo, Japan. Their mission is to infiltrate the subconscious mind in order to eradicate self-doubt and negative energy. Utilizing their arsenal of optimism, confidence, fantasy, intelligence and female empowerment, these five women create surreal aural landscapes in which fear can’t exist.

J-Pop veterans SAYAKA, KAEDE, MIYUU, RURI (previously in Happiness and E-Girls) and RUI (iScream) join forces to make Japanese pop music for an international audience.

Debut album SEQUENCE 01 is the first sequence of dreams carefully coded by f5ve, who has infused unique dream data into every song that will be experienced differently by each listener. Executive produced by grammy award winner BloodPop® with co-production from BRITs producer of the year A. G. Cook, Count Baldor, Hudson Mohawke, AOBeats and a feisty feature from Kesha, the album transcends multiple genres while maintaining electronic japanese edge. Exploring themes of oppressive work culture, magical clocks that can control time, aliens that play gacha games, being as tiny as a ladybug or as big as Tokyo Tower, and simply eating a lot of lettuce; this album is a whacky yet cohesive trip into a nostalgic future where anything is possible.

Debut album Sequence 01 out now! Check our website to stream, buy merch, and see live dates ! https://www.f5veofficial.com/

I'm a Canadian who is somewhat into British TV, which led me into Celebrity Bear Hunt on Netflix. One of the cast members on that show was Una Healy, who I learned was in an early 2010s girl group called The Saturdays.

I noticed that this group had a TV show in the USA called *Chasing the Saturdays* in 2013 which covered their attempt to break that country. However, despite their best efforts, it doesn't look they succeeded in that venture.

Since all of you are vastly more knowledgeable on the subject than I am, I wanted to get your opinions on why The Saturdays didn't manage to break the United States. Was it lack of promotion? Their sound? Something else? Please enlighten me.

Thanks!",1750596453.0,47,2025-06-22 12:47:33+00:00,12,6

1lgqijd,"One year ago today, Charli XCX released the Girl, So Confusing remix featuring Lorde",SiphenPrax,popheads,620,0.95,0,620,52,True,"Back in 2013, English singer Charli XCX burst on the scene with her debut album *True Romance* on April 13, 2013 shortly after already being featured on the hit song “I Love It.” Over five months later, New Zealander singer Lorde also burst on the scene with her debut album *Pure Heroine* that was released on September 27, 2013 and came packed with her mega chart topper “Royals.” For the next 11 years the two artists would be constantly compared by various outlets in the media and even pitted against one another as their careers progressed. It would also get to both artists mentally as they had their insecurities about how the other was doing compared to themselves. When the original version of the song came out on the Charli’s critically acclaimed album *Brat*, fan speculation exploded into various debates on if the song was a diss track from Charli aimed directly at Lorde. In actuality, the song was actually a tribute to Lorde and she was the inspiration behind the track. Charli contacted Lorde to do a remix of the song a day before *Brat* came out. Charli was prepared to get denied by Lorde but she heard the song before she got Charli’s message due to the time zone differences. They then together worked it out on the remix and put out what many consider to be one of the best, if not the best, song of the jam-packed music year that was 2024.

The remix, accompanied by the mirrored reflection art cover, explore themes of insecurities, jealousy, and forced role-playing by the greater powers at hand. Lorde in particular expresses her years-long battle with obesophobia and her issues with self-confidence in being pitted to be like Charli. Charli on the other hand expresses her envy of Lorde and doing everything to try and be like her for years since she was always compared to her. It truly became a meeting of the mods between two side of the same coin.

The song was critically acclaimed upon release gaining several distinctions included the coveted “Best New Music” honor from Pitchfork and ended up being either Number 1 or in the Top 5 of several year-end lists for the best songs of 2024. All in all, the song represented the anticipated delivery of two very similar artists pitted against each other by a ruthless industry to finally make peace and express their true feelings defiantly for the whole music industry and world to witness

Here are some questions for discussion to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Charli XCX’s Girl, So Confusing remix featuring Lorde

1. What are your thoughts on the remix today? 
2. Has your opinion on the remix changed at all in the past year since it came out?
3. Would like Charli XCX and Lorde to collaborate again in the future or is the remix too perfect that it should not be tainted with more collaborations? 
4. How would you rank this remix amongst both Charli XCX and Lorde’s other pieces of work?
5. What do you believe, if any, will be the lasting legacy of the remix?",1750489678.0,84,2025-06-21 07:07:58+00:00,7,5

1lgl3h1,Ask Billboard: Which Artists Have the Best Average of Hitting No. 1 on the Hot 100?,Level_Position3773,popheads,79,0.98,0,79,29,True,"“Mariah Carey’s latest hit is a great achievement, considering she is a legacy artist on the Billboard Hot 100. Out of her 50 career entries, 19 are No. 1s and, by the end of the year, she may hold the record for the longest-running No. 1, ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You.’

“On a side note, Mariah has Hot 100 No. 1s in eras dominated by physical releases (1990s), digital distribution (2000s) and streaming (‘10s, ‘20s).”

Lambs are smiling this week, as Carey claims her 50th Hot 100 hit, “Type Dangerous.”

The feat had Carey fans, and chart fans, noting the impressive percentage of her career entries that have gone to No. 1 or the top 10 on the Hot 100. With 50 making for easy math (phew), her 19 No. 1s translate to a 38% success rate in ruling the chart, while her 28 top 10s make for 56% of her charted titles hitting the top 10.

How do those numbers compare to others over the Hot 100’s nearly 67-year history?

Twenty-five acts have notched eight or more Hot 100 No. 1s. Among them, here’s a ranking of the artists with the highest rate of chart entries having hit No. 1, through the survey dated June 21.

Artist, Percentage of Hot 100 Entries Hitting No. 1:

George Michael, 42% (8 No. 1s of 19 total entries)
Mariah Carey, 38 (19 of 50)
The Beatles, 27.8 (20 of 72)
Whitney Houston, 27.5 (11 of 40)
The Supremes, 27 (12 of 45)
Phil Collins, 25.9 (7 of 27)
Bruno Mars, 25.7 (9 of 35)
Michael Jackson, 25.5 (13 of 51)
Katy Perry, 25 (9 of 36)
Janet Jackson, 24 (10 of 41)
Rihanna, 22 (14 of 63)
Bee Gees, 20.9 (9 of 43)
Madonna, 20.7 (12 of 58)
Paul McCartney, 19 (9 of 47)
Usher, 17 (9 of 53)
Stevie Wonder, 16 (10 of 63)
The Rolling Stones, 14 (8 of 57)
Elton John, 13 (9 of 71)
Beyoncé, 8.5 (9 of 106)
Ariana Grande, 8.4 (8 of 95)
Justin Bieber, 7.6 (8 of 105)
Elvis Presley, 6.4 (7 of 109)
The Weeknd, 6 (7 of 117)
Taylor Swift, 5 (12 of 264)
Drake, 4 (13 of 358)

George Michael reigns with the best percentage of Hot 100 hits reaching No. 1, at 42%. In baseball terms, that’s a Ted Williams-esque .420 batting average. Carey follows at a likewise Cooperstown-worthy .380.

Notably, Michael’s total covers only his solo Hot 100 hits, including Wham!’s “Careless Whisper,” on which he’s also listed as a solo featured artist. If rolling up the duo’s history — three No. 1s among nine entries — into his as a soloist, Michael would still rank first with a 39% rate of topping the Hot 100, just above Carey’s 38%.

Clearly, the relatively recent evolution of music consumption works against this stat, as Drake (4%), Taylor Swift (5%) and The Weeknd (6%) round out the ranking above. Unlike in prior eras, so-called album bombs have swelled certain acts’ totals of charted hits — and in a week that Swift holds the top 14 titles, only one can be No. 1. If anything, their placements on the list above make for a badge of honor, with Drake boasting a record 358 career entries and Swift, a runner-up 264.

How about artists’ rates of hitting the Hot 100’s top 10?

Again, in looking at the 25 artists with eight or more Hot 100 No. 1s, here’s a rundown of the acts with the highest frequencies to date of chart entries having hit the top 10.

Artist, Percentage of Hot 100 Entries Hitting the Top 10:

George Michael, 79% (15 top 10s of 19 total entries)
Janet Jackson, 65.9 (27 of 41)
Madonna, 65.5 (38 of 58)
Michael Jackson, 59 (30 of 51)
Whitney Houston, 58 (23 of 40)
Bruno Mars, 57 (20 of 35)
Mariah Carey, 56 (28 of 50)
Phil Collins, 52 (14 of 27)
Rihanna, 51 (32 of 63)
Paul McCartney, 48.9 (23 of 47)
The Beatles, 48.6 (35 of 72)
tie, The Supremes, 44.4 (20 of 45)
tie, Stevie Wonder, 44.4 (28 of 63)
Elton John, 41 (29 of 71)
The Rolling Stones, 14 (23 of 57)
Katy Perry, 39 (14 of 36)
Bee Gees, 34.8 (15 of 43)
Usher, 33.9 (18 of 53)
Justin Bieber, 25 (26 of 105)
Ariana Grande, 23.2 (22 of 95)
Elvis Presley, 22.9 (25 of 109)
Beyoncé, 22.6 (24 of 106)
Taylor Swift, 22.348 (59 of 264)
Drake, 22.346 (80 of 358)
The Weeknd, 17 (20 of 117)

George Michael again takes top honors, with a lofty 79% of the late singer-songwriter’s Hot 100 hits having reached the top 10. (His only four that didn’t: “Waiting for That Day,” No. 27 peak, 1991; the song’s B-side that became popular amid the Gulf War, “Mother’s Pride,” No. 46, 1991; “Somebody to Love,” with Queen, No. 30, 1993; and “Killer”/“Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone,” No. 69, 1993.)

As with his percentage of No. 1s, Michael would still rank first on the list above if factoring in Wham!, whose nine Hot 100 hits have resulted in seven top 10s — an almost identical high rate, 78%, to his 79% solo. It took some time for the totals to nearly align: Following its 1984 release, Wham!’s “Last Christmas” jingled to the top 10 at last in 2021, reaching a No. 3 best this past holiday season. (Michael is also two-for-two on songs named “Freedom.”)

Carey has the eighth-best rate of Hot 100 charted titles making the top 10, and the fourth-best among women, after Janet Jackson, Madonna and Whitney Houston, with all four driven largely by their sterling track records (of tracks, or records) in the ‘80s and/or ‘90s.

Two coincidences stand out above. Paul McCartney has hit the Hot 100’s top 10 with 48.9% of his solo entries on the chart, just a touch above the Beatles’ 48.6% showing. Meanwhile, it takes three decimal points for Swift (22.348%) to place just above Drake (22.346%) when it comes to their titles reaching the top 10.


One other act comes to mind regarding this research. Of the 307 artists with at least five Hot 100 top 10s, only one has perfect attendance in terms of all its entries on the chart having reached the top 10. In fact, all five hit the top five, and three ascended to No. 1 — “Baby Don’t Forget My Number,” “Girl I’m Gonna Miss You” and “Blame It on the Rain” all led, “Girl You Know It’s True” hit No. 2 and final charted single “All or Nothing” peaked at No. 4.

Milli Vanilli, thus, owns a unique slice of Hot 100 history, even if it’s somewhat owed to the abrupt end of its chart run. Perhaps the mark adds further shine to the pair, which in recent years has been looked upon much more kindly than when it was always a lock for the chart’s upper reaches.
